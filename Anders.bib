  abstract = {The actinic flux describes the number of photons incident at a point,
	while the irradiance describes the radiant energy crossing a surface.
	An algorithm for conversion of irradiance to downwelling actinic
	flux has been developed and tested. The algorithm uses a simple method
	to distinguish between a cloudy and a cloudless sky. It is necessary
	to separate cloudy and cloudless situations, as the irradiance to
	actinic flux conversion depends on the radiance field which is rather
	different for cloudy and cloudless skies. Surface UV irradiance and
	downwelling actinic flux spectra were measured at five European locations
	which were representative of different climates. A total of 9015
	synchronized actinic flux and irradiance spectra were available to
	test the proposed algorithm. The measured irradiance spectra were
	used to estimate downwelling actinic flux spectra. The estimated
	actinic flux spectra were compared with the measured actinic flux
	spectra for all cloud and aerosol situations encountered, a wide
	range of solar zenith angles, and surface conditions. The average
	ratio of the reproduced to measured downwelling actinic flux is 1.021
	+/- 0.085 in the UV-B and 1.015 +/- 0.105 in the UV-A. In general,
	the performance of the algorithm is better at smaller solar zenith
	angles.},
