## Research on plant responses to ultraviolet radiation {#sec:plants:UVB}

Plants are exposed to ultraviolet () radiation in their natural
habitats. The amount and quality of radiation they are exposed to
depends on the time of the year, the latitude, the elevation, position
in the canopy, clouds and aerosols, and for aquatic plants the depth,
solutes and particles contained in the water (see sections
[1.4](#sec:solar:radiation){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:solar:radiation"} and
[1.6](#sec:UV:aquatic){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:UV:aquatic"}). Ultraviolet radiation is consequently a
carrier of information about the environment of plants. However, when
exposed to enhanced doses of radiation or radiation of short
wavelengths, plants can be damaged. When exposed to small doses of
radiation plants respond by a mechanism involving the perception of the
radiation through a photoreceptor called UVR8
[@Jenkins2009b; @Rizzini2011; @Wu2011; @Christie2012; @DiWu2012; @Heijde2012].
This protein behaves as a pigment at the top of a transduction chain
that regulates gene expression. Several genes have been identified as
regulated by radiation perceived through UVR8. Some are related to the
metabolism of phenolic compounds and are involved in the accumulation of
these metabolites.[^1] However, these are not the only genes regulated
by UVR8. Genes related to hormone metabolism are also affected, and this
could be one of the mechanisms for photomorphogenesis by radiation, for
example an increase in leaf thickness or reduction in height of plants.
Morphological effects of mediated by UVR8 have been described
[@Wargent2009b].

The irradiance of in sunlight is larger than the irradiance of and
plants also have photoreceptors that absorb both radiation and blue
light. The best studied of these photoreceptors are cryptochromes and
phototropins. Cryptochromes are involved in many photomorphogenic
responses, including the accumulation of pigments. Phototropins are well
known for their role in plant movements such as stomatal opening in blue
light and the movement of chloroplasts [see
@Christie2007; @Shimazaki2007; @Moeglich2010 for recent reviews].

The balance between the different wavebands, , and (photosynthetically
active radiation, 400--700 nm), has a big influence on the effect of
radiation on plants. Unrealistically low levels of radiation and enhance
the effects of [e.g. @Caldwell1994c]. One reason for this is that
radiation is required for photoreactivation, the repair of DNA damage in
the light.

From the 1970's until the 1990's the main interest in research on the
effects of on plants and other organisms was generated by the increase
in ambient exposure caused by ozone depletion in the stratosphere [e.g.
@Caldwell1971; @Caldwell1989; @Tevini1993; @Caldwell1994b]. This led to
many studies on the effects of increased radiation, both outdoors, in
greenhouses and in controlled environments. Frequently the results
obtained in outdoor experiments differed from those obtained indoors.
This lead to the realization that it is important to use realistic
experimental conditions with respect to radiation and its ratio compared
to other bands of the solar spectrum. Interactions of responses to
radiation with other environmental factors like availability of mineral
nutrients, water and temperature, were also uncovered. Effects on
terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of ozone depletion, and the
concomitant increase in radiation, have been periodically reviewed in
@UNEP2011 [and earlier reports]. These reports include chapters on
terrestrial ecosystems [@Ballare2011] and aquatic ecosystems
[@Hader2011].

From the 1990's onwards, the interest in the study of the effects of
normal (i.e. without stratospheric ozone depletion), as opposed to
enhanced radiation increased markedly [e.g.
@Paul2001; @Aphalo2003; @Jansen2012]. This was in part due to the
realization that even low exposures elicit plant responses, and that
these are important for the acclimation of plants to their normal growth
environment. Furthermore, as these effects were characterized, interest
developed in their possible applications in agriculture and especially
horticulture [e.g. @Paul2005].

A further subject of current interest is the enhanced release of
greenhouse gases from green and dead biomass caused by action of
radiation on pectins [e.g. @Messenger2009; @Bloom2010]. Another
long-standing subject of research are the direct and indirect effects of
solar radiation on litter decomposition [e.g.
@Newsham1997a; @Newsham2001; @Austin2010].

To be able to obtain reliable results from experiments on the effects of
radiation on plants, there are many different problems that need to be
addressed. This requires background knowledge of both photobiology,
radiation physics, and climatology.

## The principles of photochemistry {#sec:photobio:principles}

*Light* is electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths to which the human
eye, as well as the photosynthetic apparatus, is sensitive
($\lambda \approx$ 400 to 700 nm). However, sometimes the word *light*
is also used to refer to other nearby regions of the spectrum:
ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths than visible light) and infra-red
(longer wavelengths). Both particle and wave attributes of radiation are
needed for a complete description of its behaviour. Light particles or
quanta are called photons.

Sensing of visible and radiation by plants and other organisms starts as
a photochemical event, and is ruled by the basic principles of
photochemistry:

Grotthuss law

:   Only radiation that is actually absorbed can produce a chemical
    change.

Stark-Einstein law

:   Each absorbed quantum activates only one molecule.

As electrons in molecules can have only discrete energy levels, only
photons that provide a quantity of energy adequate for an electron to
'jump' to another possible energetic state can be absorbed. The
consequence of this is that substances have colours, i.e. they absorb
photons with only certain energies. See @Nobel2009 and @Bjorn2007 for
detailed descriptions of the interactions between light and matter.

## Physical properties of ultraviolet and visible radiation {#sec:radiation:properties}

In a physical sense, ultraviolet () and visible (VIS) radiation
(i.e. also PAR) are electromagnetic waves and are described by the
Maxwell's equations.[^2] The wavelength ranges of and visible radiation
and their usual names are listed in Table
[\[tab:Waverange\]](#tab:Waverange){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:Waverange"}. The long wavelengths of solar radiation,
called infrared (IR) radiation, are also listed. The colour ranges
indicated in Table
[\[tab:Waverange\]](#tab:Waverange){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:Waverange"} are an approximation. The electromagnetic
spectrum is continuous with no clear boundaries between one colour and
the next. Especially in the IR region the subdivision is somewhat
arbitrary and the boundaries used in the literature vary. Radiation can
also be thought of as composed of quantum particles or photons. The
energy of a quantum of radiation in a vacuum, , depends on the
wavelength, $\lambda$, or frequency[^3], $\nu$,
$$\quantum = h \cdot \nu = h \cdot \frac{c}{\lambda} \label{equ_energy}$$
with the Planck constant $h=6.626\times 10^{-34}$ and speed of light in
vacuum $c=2.998\times 10^{8}$ . When dealing with numbers of photons,
the equation ([\[equ_energy\]](#equ_energy){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_energy"}) can be extended by using Avogadro's number
$N_\mathrm{A}=6.022\times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$. Thus, the energy of one
mole of photons, , is
$$\molequanta = h' \cdot \nu = h' \cdot \frac{c}{\lambda} \label{equ_molenergy}$$
with $h'=h\cdot N_\mathrm{A}=3.990\times 10^{-10}$ . Example 1: red
light at 600 nm has about 200 , therefore, 1 $\mymu$mol photons has
0.2 J. Example 2: radiation at 300 nm has about 400 , therefore,
1 $\mymu$mol photons has 0.4 J. Equations
[\[equ_energy\]](#equ_energy){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_energy"} and
[\[equ_molenergy\]](#equ_molenergy){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_molenergy"} are valid for all kinds of electromagnetic
waves.

When a beam or the radiation passing into a space or sphere is analysed,
two important parameters are necessary: the distance to the source and
the measuring position---i.e. if the receiving surface is perpendicular
to the beam or not. The geometry is illustrated in Figure
[\[fig_space\]](#fig_space){reference-type="ref" reference="fig_space"}
with a radiation source at the origin. The radiation is received at
distance $r$ by a surface of area d$A$, tilted by an angle $\alpha$ to
the unit sphere's surface element, so called solid angle, d$\Omega$,
which is a two-dimensional angle in a space. The relation between d$A$
and d$\Omega$ in spherical coordinates is geometrically explained in
Figure [\[fig_space\]](#fig_space){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig_space"}.

::: figure*
![image](figures/sphere_highres.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

The solid angle is calculated from the zenith angle $\theta$ and azimuth
angle $\phi$, which denote the direction of the radiation beam
$${\rm d}\Omega = {\rm d}\theta\cdot\sin\theta{\rm d}\phi \label{equ_dsolidangle}$$
The area of the receiving surface is calculated by a combination of the
solid angle of the beam, the distance $r$ from the radiation source and
the angle $\alpha$ of the tilt:
$${\rm d}A  =  \frac{r{\rm d}\theta}{\cos\alpha}\cdot r\sin\theta{\rm d}\phi$$
which can be rearranged to
$$\Rightarrow {\rm d}A  =  \frac{r^2}{\cos\alpha}\quad{\rm d}\Omega$$
Thus, the solid angle is given by
$$\Omega = \int_A \frac{{\rm d}A\cdot\cos\alpha}{r^2} \label{equ_solidangle}$$
The unit of the solid angle is a steradian (sr). The solid angle of an
entire sphere is calculated by integration of equation
([\[equ_dsolidangle\]](#equ_dsolidangle){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_dsolidangle"}) over the zenith ($\theta$) and azimuth
($\phi$) angles, $0\le\theta\le\pi(180^\circ)$ and
$0\le\phi\le2\pi(360^\circ)$, and is $4\pi$ sr. For example, the sun or
moon seen from the Earth's surface appear to have a diameter of about
$0.5^\circ$ which corresponds to a solid angle element of about
$6.8\times 10^{-5}$ sr.

The processes responsible for the variation of the radiance
$L(\lambda,\theta,\phi)$ as the radiation beam travels through any kind
of material, are primarily absorption $a$ and scattering $b$, which are
called inherent optical properties, because they depend only on the
characteristics of the material itself and are independent of the light
field. Radiance is added to the directly transmitted beam, coming from
different directions, due to elastic scattering, by which a photon
changes direction but not wavelength or energy level. An example of this
is Raleigh scattering in very small particles, which causes the
scattering of light in a rainbow. A further gain of radiance into the
direct path is due to inelastic processes like fluorescence, where a
photon is absorbed by the material and reemitted as a photon with a
longer wavelength and lower energy level, and Raman scattering. The
elastic and inelastic scattered radiance is denoted as $L^E$ and $L^I$,
respectively. Internal sources of radiances, $L^S$, like bioluminescence
of biological organisms or cells contribute also to the detected
radiance. The path of the radiance through a thin horizontal layer with
thickness d$z=z_1-z_0$ is shown schematically in Figure
[\[fig_radtrans\]](#fig_radtrans){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig_radtrans"}.

Putting all this together, the radiative transfer equation is
$$\cos\theta\,\frac{{\rm d}L}{{\rm d}z} = -(a+b)\cdot L + L^E + L^I + L^S \label{equ_rte}$$
The dependencies of $L$ on $\lambda$, $\theta$, and $\phi$ are omitted
here for brevity. No exact analytical solution to the radiative transfer
equation exists, hence it is necessary either to use numerical models or
to make approximations and find an analytical parameterisation. A
numerical model is for example the Monte Carlo method. The parameters of
the light field can be simulated by modelling the paths of photons. For
an infinite number of photons the light field parameters reach their
exact values asymptotically. The advantage of the Monte Carlo method is
a relatively simple structure of the program, and it simulates nature in
a straightforward way, but its disadvantage is the time-consuming
computation involved. Details of the Monte Carlo method are explained
for example by @prahl89, @Wang1995[^4], or @moble94.

The other way to solve the radiative transfer equation is through the
development of analytical parameterisations by making approximations for
all the quantities needed. In this case, the result is not exact, but it
has the advantage of fast computing and the analytical equations can be
inverted just as fast. This leads to the idealised case of a source-free
($L^S=0$) and non-scattering media, i.e. $b=0$ and therefore
$L^E=L^I=0$. Then, equation [\[equ_rte\]](#equ_rte){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_rte"} can be integrated easily and yields
$$%L(z_1) = L(z_0)\cdot\exp\left\{-\frac{a\cdot(z_1-z_0)}{\cos\theta}\right\} \label{eq:Beer-Lambert}
L(z_1) = L(z_0)\cdot \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{a\cdot(z_1-z_0)}{\cos\theta}} \label{eq:Beer-Lambert}$$
The boundary value $L(z_0)$ is presumed known. This result is known as
Beer's law (or Lambert's law, Bouguer's law, Beer-Lambert law), denotes
any instance of exponential attenuation of light and is exact only for
purely absorbing media---i.e. media that do not scatter radiation. It is
of direct application in analytical chemistry, as it describes the
direct proportionality of absorbance () to the concentration of a
coloured solute in a transparent solvent.

Different physical quantities are used to describe the "amount of
radiation" and their definitions and abbreviations are listed in
Table [\[tab:Phys:Quants\]](#tab:Phys:Quants){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:Phys:Quants"}. Taking into account Equation
[\[equ_solidangle\]](#equ_solidangle){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_solidangle"} and assuming a homogenous flux, the
important correlation between irradiance $\irr$ and intensity
$\intensity$ is
$$E = \frac{\intensity \cdot \cos\alpha}{r^2} \label{equ_r2law}$$ The
irradiance decreases by the square of the distance to the source and
depends on the tilt of the detecting surface area. This is valid only
for point sources. For outdoor measurements the sun can be assumed to be
a point source. For artificial light sources simple LEDs (light-emitting
diodes) without optics on top are also effectively point sources.
However, LEDs with optics---and other artificial light sources with
optics or reflectors designed to give a more focused dispersal of the
light---deviate to various extents from the rule of a decrease of
irradiance proportional to the square of the distance from the light
source.

Besides the physical quantities used for all electromagnetic radiation,
there are also equivalent quantities to describe visible radiation, so
called photometric quantities. The human eye as a detector led to these
photometric units, and they are commonly used by lamp manufacturers to
describe their artificial light sources. See Box
[\[box:photometric:quantities\]](#box:photometric:quantities){reference-type="ref"
reference="box:photometric:quantities"} on page for a short description
of these quantities and units.

When we are interested in photochemical reactions, the most relevant
radiation quantities are those expressed in photons. The reason for this
is that, as discussed in section
[1.2](#sec:photobio:principles){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:photobio:principles"} on page , molecules are excited by
the absorption of certain fixed amounts of energy or quanta. The surplus
energy "decays" by non-photochemical processes. When studying
photosynthesis, where many photons of different wavelengths are
simultaneously important, we normally use photon irradiance to describe
amount of . The name photosynthetic photon flux density, or , is also
frequently used when referring to photon irradiance. When dealing with
energy balance of an object instead of photochemistry, we use (energy)
irradiance. In meteorology both and visible radiation, are quantified
using energy-based quantities. When dealing with photochemistry as in
responses mediated by UVR8, an photoreceptor, the use of quantum
quantities is preferred. According to the physical energetic quantities
in the table
[\[tab:Phys:Quants\]](#tab:Phys:Quants){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:Phys:Quants"}, the equivalent photon related quantities
are listed in the table below and have the subscript $\mathrm{p}$.

These quantities can be also used based on a 'chemical' amount of moles
by dividing the quantities by Avogadro's number
$N_A=6.022\times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$. To determine a quantity in terms
of photons, an energetic quantity has to be weighted by the number of
photons, i.e. divided by the energy of a single photon at each
wavelength as defined in equation
[\[equ_energy\]](#equ_energy){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_energy"}. This yields for example
$$\Phi_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\lambda}{h\;c}\cdot\frac{\partial\quantum}{\partial t}\hspace{1cm}\mathrm{and}\hspace{1cm}\pfd(\lambda) = \frac{\lambda}{h\;c}\cdot E(\lambda)$$
When dealing with bands of wavelengths, for example an integrated value
like from 400 to 700 nm, it is necessary to repeat these calculations at
each wavelength and then integrate over the wavelengths. For example,
the photon irradiance or in moles of photons is obtained by
$$\PPFD = \frac{1}{N_\mathrm{A}}\int_{400\;\mathrm{nm}}^{700\,\mathrm{nm}}\frac{\lambda}{hc}\;E(\lambda)\;\mathrm{d}\lambda$$
For integrated values of or radiation the calculation is done
analogously by integrating from 280 to 315 nm or 315 to 400 nm,
respectively.

If we have measured (energy) irradiance, and want to convert this value
to photon irradiance, the exact conversion will be possible only if we
have information about the spectral composition of the measured
radiation. Conversion factors at different wavelengths are given in the
table below. For , 1 of "average daylight" is approximately 4.6 . This
is exact only if the radiation is equal from 400 to 700 nm, because the
factor is the value at the central wavelength at 550 nm. Further details
are discussed in section
[\[sec:basic:concepts\]](#sec:basic:concepts){reference-type="ref"

There are, in principle, two possible approaches to measuring radiation.
The first is to observe light from one specific direction or viewing
angle, which is the radiance $\radiance$. The second is to use a
detector, which senses radiation from more than one direction and
measures the so-called irradiance $\irr$ of the entire sphere or
hemisphere. The correlation between irradiance $\irr$ and radiance
$\radiance$ of the wavelength $\lambda$ is given by integrating over all
directions of incoming photons. $$\begin{aligned}
\irr[0](\lambda) & = \int_\Omega \radiance(\lambda,\Omega) {\rm d}\Omega \label{equ_E0} \\
\irr(\lambda) & = \int_\Omega \radiance(\lambda,\Omega) |\cos\alpha| {\rm d}\Omega \label{equ_E}
%\end{eqnarray}
\end{aligned}$$ Depending on the shape of a detector (which may be
either planar or spherical) the irradiance is called (plane) irradiance
$\irr$ or fluence rate (also called scalar irradiance) $\flrat$. A
planar sensor detects incoming photons depending on the incident angle
and a spherical sensor detects all photons equally weighted for all
directions. See section
[\[sec:basic:concepts\]](#sec:basic:concepts){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:basic:concepts"} on page for a more detailed discussion.

Here we have discussed the properties of light based on energy
quantities. In photobiology there are good reasons to quantify radiation
based on photons. See Box

## UV in solar radiation {#sec:solar:radiation}

When dealing with solar radiation, we frequently need to describe the
position of the sun. The azimuth angle ($\phi$) is measured clockwise
from the North on a horizontal plane. The position on the vertical plane
is measured either as the zenith angle ($\theta$) downwards from the
zenith, or as an elevation angle ($h$) upwards from the horizon.
Consequently $h + \theta = 90\degree = \frac{\pi}{2}\,$radians. See
Figure
[\[fig:solar:position\]](#fig:solar:position){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:solar:position"} for a diagram. In contrast to Figure
[\[fig_space\]](#fig_space){reference-type="ref" reference="fig_space"}
and the discussion in section
[1.3](#sec:radiation:properties){reference-type="ref"

is located at the origin of the system of coordinates, when describing
the position of the sun as in Figure

Ultraviolet and visible radiation are part of solar radiation, which
reaches the Earth's surface in about eight minutes ($t$ = time, $r_0$ =
distance sun to earth, $c$ = velocity of light in vacuum):
$$t = \frac{r_0}{c} \approx \frac{150 \times 10^9 ~{\rm m}}{3 \times 10^8 ~\frac{\rm m}{\rm s}} = 500 ~{\rm s} = 8.3 ~{\rm min}$$
The basis of all passive measurements is the incoming solar radiation,
which can be estimated from the known activity of the sun ('productivity
of photons'), that can be approximated by the emitted spectral radiance
() described by Planck's law of black body radiation at temperature $T$,
measured in degrees Kelvin (K):
$$%\radiance[s](\lambda,T) = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5}\cdot\frac{1}{\exp\left\{hc/k_BT\lambda\right\}-1} \label{equ_planck}
\radiance[s](\lambda,T) = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5}\cdot\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}^{(hc/k_\mathrm{B}T\lambda)}-1} \label{equ_planck}$$
with Boltzmann's constant $k_\mathrm{B}=1.381\times 10^{-23}$ . The
brightness temperature of the sun can be determined by Wien's
displacement law, which gives the peak wavelength of the radiation
emitted by a blackbody as a function of its absolute temperature
$$\lambda_{max} \cdot T = 2.898 \times 10^6 \,{\rm nm\,K} \label{equ_wien}$$
This means that for a maximum emission of the sun at about 500 nm the
temperature of the sun surface is about 5800 K. The spectral irradiance
of the sun $\irr[s](\lambda)$ can be estimated assuming a homogeneous
flux and using the correlation of intensity and radiance from their
definitions in table
[\[tab:Phys:Quants\]](#tab:Phys:Quants){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:Phys:Quants"}. The intensity of the sun
$\intensity[s](\lambda)$ is given by the radiance
$\radiance[s](\lambda)$ multiplied by the apparent sun surface (a
non-tilted disk of radius $r_s=7\times 10^5$ km). To calculate the
decreased solar irradiance at the moment of reaching the Earth's
atmosphere, the distance of the sun to the Earth ($r_0=150\times 10^6$
km) has to be taken into account due to the inverse square law of
irradiance of equation ([\[equ_r2law\]](#equ_r2law){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_r2law"}). Thus, the extraterrestrial solar irradiance is
$$\irr[s](\lambda)=\radiance[s](\lambda)\cdot\frac{\pi r_s^2}{r_0^2}\label{equ_extraterrestrial}$$
Remembering the solid angle of equation
([\[equ_solidangle\]](#equ_solidangle){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_solidangle"}), the right multiplication factor represents
the solid angle of the sun's disk as seen from the Earth's surface
($\approx 6.8\times 10^{-5}$ sr). Figure
[\[fig_sun\]](#fig_sun){reference-type="ref" reference="fig_sun"} shows
the spectrum of the measured extraterrestrial solar radiation (Wehrli,
1985)[^5] and the spectrum calculated by equation 1.14 using Planck's
law of equation 1.12 at a black body temperature of 5800 K. Integrated
over all wavelengths, $\irr[s]$ is about 1361 to 1362 at top of the
atmosphere [@Kopp2011]. This value is called the 'solar constant'. In
former times, depending on different measurements, $\irr[s]$ varies by a
few percent [@iqbal83]. For example, the irradiance at the top of the
atmosphere (the integrated value) changes by $\pm 50$ (3.7 %) during the
year due to distance variation caused by orbit excentricity [@moble94].
More accurate measurements during the last 25 years by spaceborne
radiometers show a variability of the solar radiation of a few tenth of
a percent. A detailed analysis is given by @froeh04. $\irr[s]$ can also
be calculated by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: the total energy emitted from
the surface of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its
temperature. For an isotropically emitting source (Lambertian emitter),
this means
$$\radiance = \frac{\sigma}{\pi} \cdot T^4 \label{equ_boltzmann}$$ with
the Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\sigma=5.6705\times 10^{-8}$ W m$^{-2}$
K$^{-4}$. With $T = 5800$ K equation
[\[equ_boltzmann\]](#equ_boltzmann){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_boltzmann"} gives the radiance of the solar disc. From
this value, we can obtain an approximation of the solar constant, by
taking into account the distance from the Earth to the Sun and the
apparent size of the solar disc (see equations
[\[equ_solidangle\]](#equ_solidangle){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_solidangle"} and

The extraterrestrial solar spectrum differs from that at ground level
due to the absorption of radiation by the atmosphere, because the
absorption peaks of water, and other components of the atmosphere, cause
corresponding valleys to appear in the solar spectrum at ground level.
For example, estimates from measurements of the total global irradiance
at Helmholtz Zentrum München (11.60$\degree$ E, 48.22$\degree$ N, 490 m
above sea level) on two sunny days (17$^{\rm th}$ April 1996, sun zenith
angle of 38$^\circ$ and 27$^{\rm th}$ May 2005, 27$^\circ$) result in
about 5% for wavelengths below 400 nm, about 45% from 400 to 700 nm, and
about 50% above 700 nm. In relation to plant research, only the coarse
structure of peaks and valleys is relevant, because absorption spectra
of pigments *in vivo* have broad peaks and valleys. However, the solar
spectrum has a much finer structure, due to emission and absorption
lines of elements, which is not observable with the spectroradiometers
normally used in plant research.

At the Earth's surface, the incident radiation or
*[global:rad]{acronym-label="global:rad" acronym-form="singular+short"}*
has two components, [direct:rad]{acronym-label="direct:rad"
acronym-form="singular+short"} and
[diffuse:rad]{acronym-label="diffuse:rad"
acronym-form="singular+short"}. Direct radiation is radiation travelling
directly from the sun, while diffuse radiation is that scattered by the
atmosphere. Diffuse radiation is what gives the blue colour to the sky
and white colour to clouds. The relative contribution of direct and
diffuse radiation to global radiation varies with wavelength and weather
conditions. The contribution of diffuse radiation is larger in the UV
region, and in the presence of clouds (Figures
[\[fig:sky:photos\]](#fig:sky:photos){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:sky:photos"} and
[\[fig:diffuse:UV\]](#fig:diffuse:UV){reference-type="ref"

Not only total irradiance, but also the wavelength distribution of the
solar spectrum changes with the seasons of the year and time of day. The
spectral wavelength distribution is also changed by the amount of
-absorbing ozone in the atmosphere, known as the ozone column. Figure
[\[fig:solar:spectra:one:day\]](#fig:solar:spectra:one:day){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:solar:spectra:one:day"} shows how spectral irradiance
changes throughout one day. When the whole spectrum is plotted using a
linear scale the effect of ozone depletion is not visible, however, if
we plot only the region (Figure
[\[fig:solarUV:spectrum:noon\]](#fig:solarUV:spectrum:noon){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:solarUV:spectrum:noon"}) or use a logarithmic scale
(Figure
[\[fig:solar:spectra:one:day:log\]](#fig:solar:spectra:one:day:log){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:solar:spectra:one:day:log"}), the effect becomes clearly
visible. In addition, on a log scale, it is clear that the relative
effect of ozone depletion on the spectral irradiance at a given
wavelength increases with decreasing wavelength.

Seasonal variation in irradiance has a larger relative amplitude than
variation in (Figure
[\[fig:diffuse.light\]](#fig:diffuse.light){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:diffuse.light"}). This causes a seasonal variation in the
: ratio (Figure
[\[fig:UVB:Erlangen\]](#fig:UVB:Erlangen){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UVB:Erlangen"}). In addition to the regular seasonal
variation, there is random variation as a result of changes in clouds
(Figure [\[fig:UVB:Erlangen\]](#fig:UVB:Erlangen){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UVB:Erlangen"}). Normal seasonal and spatial variation in
can be sensed by plants, and could play a role in their adaptation to
seasons and/or their position in the canopy.

irradiance increases with elevation in mountains and with decreasing
latitude (Figure
[\[fig:UVB:latitude\]](#fig:UVB:latitude){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:UVB:latitude"}) and is particularly high on high
mountains in equatorial regions. This has been hypothesized to be a
factor in the determination of the tree line[^6] in these mountains
[@Flenley1992].

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_UVB_latitude.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

An increase in the irradiance is caused by depletion of the ozone layer
in the stratosphere, mainly as a consequence of the release of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in cooling devices such as
refrigerators and air conditioners, and in some spray cans [see
@Graedel1993]. The most dramatic manifestation of this has been the
seasonal formation of an "ozone hole" over Antarctica. It is
controversial whether a true ozone hole has already formed in the
Arctic, but strong depletion has occurred in year 2011 [@Manney2011] and
atmospheric conditions needed for the formation of a "deep" ozone hole
are not very different from those prevalent in recent years. Not so
dramatic, but consistent, depletion has also been observed at
mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. CFCs and some other halocarbons have
been phased out following the Montreal agreement and later updates.
However, as CFCs have a long half life in the atmosphere, of the order
of 100 years, their effect on the ozone layer will persist for many
years, even after their use has been drastically reduced. Model-based
predictions of changes in atmospheric circulation due to global climate
change have been used to derive future trends in index and ozone column
thickness [@Hegglin2009]. In addition, increased cloudiness and
pollution, could lead to decreased and , sometimes called 'global
dimming' [e.g. @Stanhill2001]. It should be noted that, through
reflection, broken clouds can locally increase irradiance to values
above those under clear-sky conditions [@Frederick1993; @Diaz1996].

## UV radiation within plant canopies

The attenuation of visible and radiation by canopies is difficult to
describe mathematically because it is a complex phenomenon. The spatial
distribution of leaves is in most cases not uniform, the display angle
of the leaves is not random, and may change with depth in the canopy,
and even in some cases with time-of-day. Here we give only a description
of the simplest approach, the use of an approximation based on Beer's
law as modified by @Monsi1953, reviewed by @Hirose2005. Beer's law
(Equation [\[eq:Beer-Lambert\]](#eq:Beer-Lambert){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:Beer-Lambert"}) assumes a homogeneous light absorbing
medium such as a solution. However, a canopy is heterogenous, with
discrete light absorbing objects (the leaves and stems) distributed in a
transparent medium (air).
$$I_z = I_0\cdot\mathrm{e}^{-K\,L_z} \label{eq:Monsi:Saeki}$$ Equation
[\[eq:Monsi:Saeki\]](#eq:Monsi:Saeki){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:Monsi:Saeki"} describes the radiation attenuated as a
function of leaf area index ($L$ or ) at a given canopy depth ($z$). The
equation does not explicitly account for the effects of the statistical
spatial distribution of leaves and the effects of changing incidence
angle of the radiation. Consequently, the empirical extinction
coefficient ($K$) obtained may vary depending on these factors. $K$ is
not only a function of plant species (through leaf optical properties,
and how leaves are displayed), but also of time-of-day, and
season-of-year---as a consequence of solar zenith angle---and degree of
scattering of the incident radiation. As the degree of scattering
depends on clouds, and also on wavelength, the extinction coefficient is
different for and visible radiation. Radiation extinction in canopies
has yet to be studied in detail with respect to radiation, mainly
because of difficulties in the measurement of radiation compared to , a
spectral region which has been extensively studied.

Ultraviolet radiation is strongly absorbed by plant surfaces, although
cuticular waxes and pubescence on leaves can sometimes increase
reflectance. The diffuse component of radiation is larger than that of
visible light (Figure
[\[fig:diffuse.light\]](#fig:diffuse.light){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:diffuse.light"}). In sunlit patches in forest gaps the
diffuse radiation percentage is lower than in open areas, because
[direct:rad]{acronym-label="direct:rad" acronym-form="singular+short"}
is not attenuated but part of the sky is occluded by the surrounding
forest. Attenuation with canopy depth is on average usually more gradual
for than for . The irradiance decreases with depth in tree canopies, but
the ratio tends to increase [see @Brown1994]. In contrast, @Deckmyn2001
observed a decrease in ratio in white clover canopies with planophyle
leaves. @Allen1975 modelled the penetration in plant canopies, under
normal and depleted ozone conditions. @Parisi1996 measured doses within
model plant canopies using dosimeters. The position of leaves affects
exposure, and it has been observed that heliotropism can moderate
exposure and could be a factor contributing to differences in tolerance
among crop cultivars [@Grant1998; @Grant1999; @Grant1999a; @Grant2004].

Detailed accounts of different models describing the interaction of
radiation and plant canopies, taking into account the properties of
foliage, are given by @Campbell1998 and @Monteith2008.

## UV radiation in aquatic environments {#sec:UV:aquatic}

As solar radiation passes through a body of water, its spectrum changes
with depth in a wavelength-dependent manner, determined by the optical
characteristics of that water body. The penetration of UV radiation
through water bodies can vary from only few centimetres in highly humic
lakes [@Kirk1994; @Kirk1994b; @Huovinen2003] to dozens of metres in the
oceans [@Smith1992; @Kirk1994; @Kirk1994b]. Some irradiance is reflected
at the water surface, but the extent to which wavelengths in the UV to
IR range penetrate water bodies depends mainly on (1) attenuation by
water itself, (2) coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and seston.
Seston is the sum of living organic material (mainly phytoplankton) and
non-living material (tripton). Non-living particles are further
distinguished between organic material (detritus) and inorganic
suspended matter. Each fraction has its own characteristic spectral
absorption and scattering properties [reviewed by
@dekke93; @Kirk1994; @Kirk1994b; @Hargreaves2003; @Wozniak2007].

Particularly in coastal areas and shallow areas of lakes and streams,
irradiance reflected from the ground or sea-bed beneath the water
(henceforth bottom) influences the profile of radiation through the
aquatic environment. This reflectance is described by a bidirectional
reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which is wavelength specific
and depends on the incident and reflected angle. If the reflectance is
equally distributed in all directions, the bottom is a so called
Lambertian reflector and the BRDF is constant. The bottom reflectance is
greatly influenced by its slope and properties, i.e. whether the bottom
is bare sediment or covered by algae and submersed vegetation [e.g.
@marit94; @alber03; @moble03a; @moble03b; @pinne07].

### Refraction

The refraction of incoming (downwelling) radiance at the water surface
can be determined by Snell's law, which describes the angular refraction
of the incident beam. The radiation passes the first medium with a
refractive index $n_1$ and then the second medium with a refractive
index $n_2$. If the incoming direction of the radiation is given by the
angle $\theta_1$, the beam is refracted to the angle $\theta_2$. Snell's
law is $$n_1 \cdot \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \cdot \sin\theta_2$$ For the case
of radiation arriving from the air under the incident angle $\theta_i$
and going into the water with the transmitted angle $\theta_t$, this
yields a refractive index for the air of $n_a=1$ and for the water of
$n_W=1.33$ $$\theta_t = \arcsin \left( 0.75\cdot \sin\theta_i \right)$$

Theoretically, $n_W$ is not constant but depends on temperature,
wavelength and salinity, as described by @quanx95. In principle, the
shorter the wavelength, the higher the refractive index of water, but in
practice the wavelength-dependent difference in refraction is
unimportant. For example comparing the values at 400 and 800 nm for
20and no salinity produces a difference of $<$ 0.5%. If the wind speed
is high, the slope of surface waves also has to be taken into account. A
rough surface reflects and transmits the incoming radiation beam in more
directions and makes the radiation field more diffuse than a smooth
surface.

### Absorption and scattering by pure water

Water itself absorbs and scatters radiation. The optical properties of
the water in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectrum are not precisely
known, since no theoretical model exists which exactly describes the
absorption and scattering properties of pure water. Therefore, it is
necessary to rely on laboratory measurements to approximate the values
of these parameters. Investigations into absorption by water $a_W$ were
initially documented by @morel74, @smith76, @smith81, @pegau93 and more
recently by @buite94 and @hakvo94. The absorption properties of water
also depend on temperature. The influence of temperature is weak below
700 nm, but its effect increases with increasing wavelength; so, for
example, a temperature increase of 10 K produces a
$\approx$`<!-- -->`{=html}7% change in the absolute value of $a_W$ at
740 nm.

The scattering of radiation by molecules in liquids has been modelled
theoretically by @smolu08 and @einst10. This approach is based on
statistical thermodynamics and is called the theory of fluctuation.
Theoretically, the scattering function is wavelength-dependent and
follows the $\lambda^{-4}$ law. Experiments show a slight deviation from
the model, giving a better correlation with $\lambda^{-4.32}$ [@morel74]
due to the effects of isothermal compressibility, the refractive index
of water, and the pressure derivative of the refractive index of water
[@hakvo94].

The wavelength dependency of the absorption and scattering coefficients
of pure water are shown in Figure
[\[fig:Water:Abs_Scat\]](#fig:Water:Abs_Scat){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Water:Abs_Scat"} using data from @hakvo94. Water mainly
contributes to the attenuation of PAR and IR wavelengths, since
absorption by pure water increases from around 550 nm towards longer
wavelengths.

### Absorption and scattering by water constituents

Absorption and scattering by water constituents is the sum of (1)
absorption by CDOM, sometimes also called yellow or humic substances,
gilvin or gelbstoff, (2) absorption and scattering by living material
like phytoplankton, and (3) absorption and scattering by dead organic
and inorganic particles. The influence of each constituent on the
scattering process depends on wavelength, particle size, concentration,
and refractive index. Theoretical details are explained in, for example,
@vhuls81.

CDOM mainly refers to coloured dissolved humic materials and consists of
humic and fulvic acids, originating from decomposed plant material
suspended in the water or entering from the surrounding catchment area.
The pigments in humic and fulvic acids absorb strongly in the blue and
UV wavelengths and are dissolved and therefore do not scatter
irradiance. @kalle66 recognised that CDOM absorption decreases
exponentially with increasing wavelength in the visible part of the
spectra. Following the study of @morel76, @brica81 expressed this
relationship in the following model: for a known absorption at a
wavelength $\lambda_0=440$ nm, the CDOM absorption $a_Y$ can be
determined by
$$a_Y(\lambda) = a_Y(\lambda_0)\cdot {\rm e}^{-s_Y(\lambda-\lambda_0)} \label{equ_ay}$$
Although the exponential coefficient $s_Y$ is variable, a standard value
of $s_Y=0.014$ nm$^{-1}$ is commonly used. @brica81 compared the value
of $s_Y$ across many data sets and reported a standard deviation of only
$\Delta s_Y=\pm 0.003$ nm$^{-1}$. The amount of CDOM in water is
determined by filtration using membrane filters of 0.2 $\mymu$m pore
size. The filtrate is collected into a quartz cuvette with length $l$
and put into a (double beam) spectrophotometer to measure its
[absorbance]{acronym-label="absorbance" acronym-form="singular+short"}
(optical density) $A(\lambda)$. Then,
$a_Y(\lambda)=2.303\cdot\frac{A(\lambda)}{l}$ [@Kirk1994]. The
absorption coefficient at 440 nm has been used as an indication of
optical colour [@Kirk1994], while size of humic molecules has been
estimated from the ratio
$\frac{a_Y(\lambda=250{\rm nm})}{a_Y(\lambda={\rm 365 nm})}$, with
increasing size indicated by smaller ratios
[@DeHaan1972; @DeHaan1987; @DeHaan1993]. To determine $a_Y$ from clearer
(e.g. oceanic) waters, a cuvette with a 10 cm path-length is generally
needed due to their low values of absorption.

Phytoplankton can contribute to the attenuation of PAR through
absorption by their photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll and
pheophytin, but they can also cause scattering. The absorption by
phytoplankton $a_P$ is the sum of absorption by each pigment multiplied
each by their concentrations. Due to the fact that many species of
phytoplankton occur in aquatic environments and every species contains
more than one pigment, it is more practicable to calculate the
absorption by mean specific absorption coefficients for each different
algal species separately. This has been done by @gegep98 for freshwater
Lake Constance in Germany and by @prieu81 for an oceanic environment.
Besides these examples, there are other models for oceanic waters that
use the specific *in vivo* absorption coefficient and concentration of
chlorophyll-*a*, $a_{chl}^*$ and $C_{chl}$, respectively. @morel91 found
that the power law $a_P = 0.06\, a_{chl}^*\, [C_{chl}]^{0.65}$, which
was first proposed by @prieu81, provided the best estimate of the
absorption coefficient for his data set. $C_{chl}$ is the concentration
of chlorophyll-*a* in units of $\mymu$g l$^{-1}$. Figure
[\[fig:Phyto:Abs\]](#fig:Phyto:Abs){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Phyto:Abs"} shows the specific oceanic chlorophyll
absorption coefficient from @morel91 normalized to maximum absorption at
440 nm. Figure [\[fig:Phyto:Abs\]](#fig:Phyto:Abs){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Phyto:Abs"} also shows laboratory measurements of
chlorophyll-*a* and chlorophyll-*b* absorption[^7] after @frigaard1996.
Spectra for chlorophyll absorption, and that of various other
photochemically-relevant substances, are also available in computer
software such as PhotochemCAD[^8] [@lindsey1998; @lindsey2005]. The
empirical model of @brica95 parameterises the specific absorption
coefficient from $C_{chl}$. This model draws on extensive studies of
more than 800 spectra to give
$a_P^*(\lambda) = A(\lambda)[C_{chl}]^{-B(\lambda)}$ with positive
empirical coefficients $A$ and $B$ depending on wavelength. The model
incorporates both the package effect of phytoplankton cells and the
effect of the varying pigment composition on absorption.

The particulate structure of phytoplankton cells causes scattering. The
influence of phytoplankton on the total scattering coefficient depends
on the other constituents of the water body. For water containing a low
concentration of inorganic suspended sediment scattering is driven by
the concentration of phytoplankton (as occurs in the open ocean).
@gordo83 developed an empirical model, which directly correlates
scattering with the pigment concentration of chlorophyll-*a* $C_{chl}$
in units of $\mymu$g l$^{-1}$. The scattering coefficient of
phytoplankton $b_P$ in units of m$^{-1}$ is given by
$$b_P(\lambda) = B \cdot [C_{chl}]^{0.62} \cdot \left(\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda}\right) \label{equ_bp_emp}$$
with $\lambda_0=550$ nm and $B=0.3$ as mean values for oceanic waters
dominated by phytoplankton. The equation
([\[equ_bp_emp\]](#equ_bp_emp){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_bp_emp"}) is valid for a range of phytoplankton
concentrations from 0.05 to 1 $\mymu$g l$^{-1}$. @gordo83 found that
oceanic waters have a value of $B\le 0.45$. Higher values are used for
other aquatic environments, for example turbid coastal waters. In
coastal regions, @sathy89 proposed that the scattering coefficient is
indirectly proportional to absorption by phytoplankton:
$b_P(\lambda) \propto 1/a_P(\lambda)$. The proportionality factor
depends on the concentration of chlorophyll-*a* in the same manner as
the scattering coefficient of equation
([\[equ_bp_emp\]](#equ_bp_emp){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_bp_emp"}). @dekke93 investigated the contribution to
scattering of each water constituent in inland waters[^9]. He found that
the composition of scattering particles was more variable in inland
waters than in the ocean and it depended on the trophic state of the
water and therefore on the distribution of organic and inorganic
particulate matter. The scattering and backscattering coefficient of
phytoplankton can be determined by
$b_P(\lambda)=b_P^*(\lambda) \cdot C_P$ where the specific scattering
coefficient of phytoplankton is $b_P^*$. For lakes @dekke93 reported
that the specific scattering coefficient of phytoplankton ranges from
0.12 to 0.18 m$^2$mg$^{-1}$ at a wavelength of 550 nm. The specific
scattering coefficients can be obtained by integrating the scattering
phase function of the observed matter, here, phytoplankton. Extensive
and commonly used measurements were done by @petzo77. Other functions
can be found for example in @moble94.

:::

Particulate matter in water bodies consists of organic and inorganic
material. The organic constituents are contained in phytoplankton cells
or are fragments of dead plankton and faecal pellets of zooplankton.
These parts are often called detritus. Inorganic particles include
suspended mineral coming from inflows or resuspension at coastal
regions. They mainly consist of quartz, clay, and calcite. There are
only a few published values of the specific absorption coefficients of
suspended particles in water from aquatic environments because they are
difficult to separate into their individual constituent parts. A
comparison of these values is given by @pozdn03. In general, absorption
by all suspended particles in most water bodies is very low and it is
negligible for inorganic particles. @roesl89 produced the following
relationship for absorption by detritus in coastal waters which is very
similar that of CDOM:
$$a_X(\lambda) = a_X(\lambda_0) \cdot {\rm e}^{-s_X(\lambda-\lambda_0)} \label{equ_adet}$$
with a mean value of $s_X=0.011$ nm$^{-1}$ and $a_X(\lambda_0)=0.09$
m$^{-1}$ at $\lambda_0=400$ nm for their data. Particulate matter in
general causes more scattering of irradiance than it absorbs. In coastal
waters and freshwater, scattering is higher than in oceanic waters due
to the additional presence of particles not related to phytoplankton.
These particles come from suspended inorganic sediments of different
sizes. Scattering is caused by differences in the refractive indices of
the two materials (the water medium and the material of the particles)
and are due to the ratio of particle size to wavelength. Different
functions of scattering coefficients and phase functions are, for
example, described by @moble94. Especially turbid and coastal waters, or
rivers and lakes, are dominated by large particles ($>1$ $\mymu$m and a
refraction index of 1.03). Therefore, the scattering coefficient of
non-living particles $b_X$ can be estimated while neglecting their size
distribution and wavelength dependence. Thus, $b_X$ is derived from
$b_X(\lambda) = b_X^* \cdot C_X$, with the concentration of the total
suspended matter $C_X$ and the specific scattering coefficients $b_X^*$.
@dekke93 gave example specific scattering coefficients of 0.23 to
0.79 m$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for different trophic states in lakes.

### Results and effects

In summary, after considering all the components that absorb radiation,
in very clear non-productive oceanic waters blue-green wavelengths in
the PAR spectrum dominate, whereas in highly-coloured, humic inland
waters blue wavelengths are rapidly attenuated. In humic lakes, CDOM
largely governs UV attenuation [e.g.
@Kirk1994; @Kirk1994b; @Scully1994; @Huovinen2003]), whereas in oceans
[@Smith1979] and clear lakes containing low CDOM concentrations the
contribution of phytoplankton to UV attenuation can be significant
[@Sommaruga1997]. If very turbid water contains a large amount of
inorganic particles, CDOM is bonded by calcium carbonate contained in
the particles, and consequently the colour of the water returns to blue.

There is marked variation in the penetration of UV radiation among water
bodies, and within a water body during the year. Global changes, such as
climate warming and acidification
[@Schindler1996; @Yan1996; @Donahue1998] can lead to increased
underwater UV penetration, likewise UV-B radiation itself which can
positively affect its own penetration through the photodegradation of
CDOM [@Morris1997]. Variation in the absorption properties of dissolved
organic compounds with the seasons and according to their origin and
molecular weight [@Stewart1980; @Hessen1998; @Lean1998], interferes with
our estimation of UV penetration based on CDOM concentrations. Temporal
changes in the absorption characteristics of CDOM have also been
reported, with fresh CDOM being photochemically more active than older
CDOM [@Lean1998]. It is also notable that UV radiation has been shown to
penetrate deeper in saline prairie lakes than in fresh waters of
corresponding CDOM concentrations [@Arts2000].

Estimations of CDOM are relatively easy to perform and therefore often
used for *in situ* and remote sensing measurements of optical
properties. However, another parameter called dissolved organic carbon
(DOC, in units of mg l$^{-1}$) is also useful to measure, since it is
more interpretable for studies of carbon cycling and in the context of
global change research. @kowal10, report that CDOM contributes
approximately 20% to the total DOC pool in the open ocean and up to 70%
in coastal areas. Unfortunately, on a global scale it has not yet been
possible to make a direct link between CDOM and DOC due to the
heterogeneous organic composition of CDOM. Until that connection is
made, estimation of the universal bulk carbon-specific CDOM absorption
coefficient, defined as the ratio of CDOM absorption to DOC
concentration, remains almost impossible [@Wozniak2007], but at least
there are good correlations between $a_Y$ and DOC concentrations in
coastal areas [@kowal10].

Aquatic organisms can be affected not only directly but also indirectly
through UV-dependent changes in the surrounding water, e.g. through
increased formation of photochemical reaction products such as singlet
oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Especially in lakes with low DOC
concentrations, photoenhanced toxicity of some environmental
contaminants or release of complexed metals into the water can occur due
to the photodegradation of organic matter
[@Zepp1982; @Palenik1991; @Hessen1994; @Arfsten1996; @Scully1997].
Despite the potential for detrimental effects, the final impact of UV
radiation on organisms may be mitigated by their protective and repair
mechanisms [@Karentz1991; @Mitchell1993; @Vincent1993], which somehow
also depend on certain wavelengths of irradiation. When evaluating the
exposure of seaweeds to UV radiation, it should be taken into account
that other factors, such as kelp canopies, can markedly reduce the PAR
and UV radiation reaching their understorey. Furthermore, the underwater
radiation received by seaweeds can be significantly altered depending on
the tidal range [@Huovinen2011]. Phenolic compounds released from large
brown algae into the surrounding water can also locally attenuate UV
radiation.

Classifications of water bodies based on their optical characteristics
have been developed as general tools in order to allow comparisons
between different water bodies. @Jerlov1976 traditional and widely-used
classification of marine waters, based on their transmittance of
irradiance at different wavelengths, recognizes three oceanic (I--III)
and nine coastal (1--9) types of water body (Figure
[\[fig:Jerlov\]](#fig:Jerlov){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Jerlov"}). @Morel1977 classified ocean waters into two
types based on their optically dominant components: (i) phytoplankton
and their products dominate case-i waters, (ii) particles and dissolved
coloured material dominate case-ii waters. The classification proposed
by @Kirk1980 is principally suited to inland waters and is based on the
spectral absorption of the soluble and particulate fractions. @Kirk1980
defined type G waters, in which CDOM is the dominant light-absorbing
component, compared with type T, W and A waters, where tripton, water
itself and phytoplankton dominate respectively. Beyond these scales,
various other optical classifications have also been proposed [reviewed
by @Kirk1994; @Hargreaves2003].

### Modelling of underwater radiation

Following Beer's law (Equation
[\[eq:Beer-Lambert\]](#eq:Beer-Lambert){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:Beer-Lambert"}), for deep water (no reflection from
bottom), radiance $L(\lambda)$ decreases exponentially with depth $z$ in
the water column:
$$L(z,\lambda) = L(z=0,\lambda)\cdot\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{a\cdot z}{\cos\theta}} \label{equ_beer}$$
alternatively written as
$$\cos\theta\,\frac{{\rm d}L(z,\lambda)}{{\rm d}z} = -a\cdot L(z,\lambda) \label{equ_dbeer}$$
$\theta$ is the zenith angle of the incoming (downwelling) radiance in
water. Note that Eqs. [\[equ_beer\]](#equ_beer){reference-type="ref"
reference="equ_beer"} and
[\[equ_dbeer\]](#equ_dbeer){reference-type="ref" reference="equ_dbeer"}
are only valid if the water column is homogeneous with depth and there
are no scattering particles and internal sources of light in the water,
i.e. no fluorescence, raman scattering, nor bioluminescence. Thus,
calculation of actual radiative transfer in water (not under idealised
conditions) is much more complicated and can only be solved
approximately by using empirical, semi-analytical or computational
models [@dekke93; @moble94; @leezp02; @alber06].

The radiative transfer equations
[\[equ_beer\]](#equ_beer){reference-type="ref" reference="equ_beer"} and
[\[equ_dbeer\]](#equ_dbeer){reference-type="ref" reference="equ_dbeer"}
are valid for radiance $L$, which represents the
[collimated]{acronym-label="collimated" acronym-form="singular+short"}
beam from one specific direction. Due to their construction, radiance
detectors do not measure a beam from an infinitely small solid angle,
they have an aperture of typically one or two degrees. Other types of
detectors sense light from more than one direction, they measure the
entire sphere or hemisphere (for details see also section
[\[sec:basic:concepts\]](#sec:basic:concepts){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:basic:concepts"} on page ), by integrating the incoming
radiance over all directions. Another useful relationship between
irradiance and fluence rate can be obtained using the Gershun equation:
$$\frac{\rm d}{{\rm d}z} E(z,\lambda) = -a \, E_0(z,\lambda) \label{equ_gershun}$$
If, for example, only the downwelling irradiance $E_d(z,\lambda)$ is
measured or necessary for calculating radiative transfer, Equation
[\[equ_dbeer\]](#equ_dbeer){reference-type="ref" reference="equ_dbeer"}
yields
$$\frac{{\rm d}E_d(z,\lambda)}{{\rm d}z} = -K_d\cdot E_d(z,\lambda) \label{equ_downirr}$$
giving the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance,
$K_d$. $K_d$ is related to the total absorption $a$ and scattering $b$
as well as to $\theta$ and also the solar zenith angle $\theta_s$
[@kirkj91; @alber03]. A practical and often-used method to estimate
$K_d$, and therefore the transparency of the water, is the Secchi disk
test. The visibility of a submerged white disk can be correlated to
downwelling diffuse attenuation [@tyler68]. This and also the
penetration depth $z_d$ give useful information about the water body.
The penetration of irradiance important for photosynthesis (primary
production) is often expressed as the depth at which, for example, 1% or
10% of the value just below the water surface is reached. The depth,
where 1% of PAR is reached, separates the euphotic zone from the aphotic
zone. After @Kirk1994, $z_d$ can be obtained from $K_d$:
$z_d(1\%) = 4.6/K_d$ and $z_d(10\%) = 2.3/K_d$. In Figure
[\[fig:Valdivia\]](#fig:Valdivia){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Valdivia"}, an example of spectral attenuation of solar
radiation at different depths, as well as the penetration depths of
UV-B, UV-A radiation and PAR are given for coastal waters of the
south-eastern Pacific Ocean (off the coast of Chile).

A very useful tool to simulate spectral radiance and irradiance under
water, depending on different concentrations of the water constituents
or bottom depth and type, is called WASI (water colour simulator,
[@gegep04]). The software includes different analytical
parameterisations and it can also be used for inverse calculations,
i.e. for estimating optical properties and concentrations of water
constituents from (remote sensing) measurements. The software program
including the manual is available free of charge using an anonymous
login at the ftp server <ftp://ftp.dfd.dlr.de/pub/WASI>. Other models,
which include angular distributions of radiation under water are, for
example, the Monte Carlo method [@prahl89; @Wang1995][^10], HydroLight
(technique described by [@moble94]), or EcoLight-S [@moble11].

## UV radiation within plant leaves {#sec:UV:leaves}

Modelling of UV-B within plant leaves has not so far been successfully
achieved. For empirical estimations of UV penetration two methods have
mainly been used: fibre-optic measurements and UV-induced fluorescence.
Neither of them is ideal and both give only partial information.

### Fibre-optic measurements

This method was introduced for visible light by @Vogelmann1984, and has
been adapted for ultraviolet radiation by Vogelmann, Bornman and
coworkers [@Bornman1988; @DeLucia1992; @Cen1993]. The method cannot be
used for absolute measurements due to uncertainties about the local
conditions and the acceptance angle at the fibre tip, but it has yielded
valuable comparisons between wavelengths and depth distributions of
radiation. Fibre probes can be made more angle-independent
[@Garcia-Pichel1995], but then become too bulky for measurements inside
plant leaves.

### UV-induced chlorophyll fluorescence

This method has so far only been employed by excitation and measurement
at the leaf surface. It thus mainly monitors penetration of UV radiation
through the epidermis into the chlorophyll-containing mesophyll,
i.e. transmission through the epidermis (Figure
[\[fig:Chl:fluorescence\]](#fig:Chl:fluorescence){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Chl:fluorescence"}). Chlorophyll fluorescence excited by
blue light usually serves as a standard [@Bilger1997; @Bilger2001], more
recently excitation by red light has also been used to avoid
interference by anthocyanins [@Goulas2004]. The principle has been used
in commercial instruments that assess the UV
[absorbance]{acronym-label="absorbance" acronym-form="singular+short"}
of the epidermis [@Kolb2005; @Goulas2004]. The first portable
instruments, *UVA-PAM* and *Dualex FLAV* used UV-A radiation for
excitation rather than UV-B radiation, but now there is at least one
instrument, *Dualex HCA*, measuring UV-B absorbance.

::: figure*
![image](figures/BG+UV-B_ChlFluor_x2_side.pdf){width="1.25\\myfigwidth"}
:::

In principle, chlorophyll fluorescence could also be used for monitoring
UV penetration in another way, by recording fluorescence in
cross-sections of leaves, as has already been done for the penetration
of visible light [@Vogelmann2000; @Vogelmann2002; @Gould2002].

### Factors affecting internal UV levels

Many studies have indicated that UV-absorbing compounds in the vacuoles
of epidermal cells have a major role in regulating internal UV levels.
However, absorbing compounds located in cell walls and other cell parts
can also be important in controlling internal UV penetration. These
compounds are usually not easily extractable, and consequently one
cannot rely on extracts alone when judging the effectiveness of
UV-screening protection. Furthermore, both wax deposits and pubescence
may be very important for protection against ultraviolet radiation
[@Karabourniotis1999; @Holmes2002]. The amount of protection can also
vary over time, even during the day, probably as a result of changes in
flavonoid concentrations [@Barnes2008a; @Veit1996]. Of course leaf
properties conferring protection also depend on environmental factors,
in particular prior UV-B exposure, and great differences exist among
plant species.

## Action and response spectra {#sec:action:spectra}

Plants do not respond equally to all wavelengths of , and this spectral
response can be described by a response spectrum and/or by an action
spectrum. It is important to be aware that an action spectrum is not the
same thing as a response spectrum. Although they are both used to
describe the wavelength dependency of a biological response to radiation
they are measured and used differently. Because they are measured in
different ways they yield curves of different shapes. A response
spectrum shows the size of the response at a *fixed photon fluence*[^11]
of radiation across a series of different wavelengths. However, since UV
radiation never comes at fixed irradiances over the entire spectrum the
response spectrum is of limited use when estimating the physiological
response to solar- or broadband UV exposure. In contrast, an action
spectrum shows the effectiveness of radiation of different wavelengths
in *achieving a given size of response*. This is a very important
difference because dose response curves are not necessarily parallel or
linear.

When estimating biologically effective irradiances (see section
[\[sec:BSWFs:UVeff\]](#sec:BSWFs:UVeff){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:BSWFs:UVeff"} on page ) it is very important to use
appropriate action spectra for each biological process. However, since
the action spectra of many biological responses are not known, this
provides a dilemma for researchers who must try to chose the action
spectrum that best approximates the process they are studying. Using the
wrong action spectrum can produce very large errors when predicting
effective irradiance and, therefore, UV effects on plants due to
e.g. ozone depletion [@Rundel1983; @Cullen1997]. This is also a good
reason for continued efforts to measure action spectra.

Building a response spectrum is fairly simple; we need to measure a
plant response at a single (photon) irradiance (or fluence) for each
wavelength (or narrow band), whereas for constructing an action spectrum
ones needs to measure the response at several different photon fluence
values for each wavelength of interest.

### Constructing a monochromatic action spectrum

Action spectra are most frequently measured using monochromatic light,
i.e. radiation of a single or narrow range of wavelengths. This can be
achieved by the use of systems which transmit, or emit, only a defined
and usually narrow range of wavelengths, e.g. band-pass filters, LEDs,
spectrographs, or lasers (see Chapter
[\[chap:manipulating\]](#chap:manipulating){reference-type="ref"
reference="chap:manipulating"} for details about radiation sources). It
is also possible to build, for example, an UV action spectrum with
background irradiation of other wavelengths such us PAR.

@Shropshire1972 describes in detail the theory behind monochromatic
action spectra, and the assumptions needed for an action spectrum to
match the absorption spectrum of a photoreceptor pigment. He also
considers the problem of how screening by other or the same pigments can
distort the shape of action spectra. He gives examples for visible
radiation but the theoretical considerations are fully applicable to
ultraviolet radiation.

To construct a true action spectrum we first need to measure dose
response curves for radiation of different wavelengths (Figure
[\[fig:construct:action:spectrum\]](#fig:construct:action:spectrum){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:construct:action:spectrum"}). The more curves we measure
and the narrower the wavelength range used for each of these, the more
spectral detail will be visible in the action spectrum built from them.
For each of these curves, we should use a range of photon fluences
yielding response sizes going from relatively small responses to close
to the maximum response size (close to saturation). The photon fluence
values used should increase exponentially. Photon fluence can be varied
both by varying irradiance and/or irradiation times. If irradiation time
is varied, it should be checked that reciprocity holds[^12]. We fit a
curve to each set of dose response data, using the logarithm of the
photon fluence as an independent variable. Using a logarithmic scale is
expected to yield a more linear response curve than untransformed photon
fluence values. From the fitted dose-response curves we calculate by
interpolation the photon fluence required at each measured wavelength to
obtain a response of the selected target response size. We use the
photon fluence values to calculate effectiveness as $1/ (\pfd \cdot t)$
where fluence is given by the product of photon irradiance () by the
irradiation time ($t$), and we finally plot these effectiveness values
against wavelength ($\lambda$). If the dose response curves are not
parallel, the shape of the action spectrum will depend on the target
response level chosen. Different causes have been suggested for the lack
of parallelism of dose response curves that is sometimes observed. Two
of these suggestions are self-screening effects and involvement of two
or more interacting pigments in the response [@Shropshire1972]. One can
in principle use either quantum (=photon) or energy units, but quantum
units are preferable as for any photochemical reaction absorption events
always involve quanta. The shape of the spectrum will depend on whether
an energy or photon basis is used.

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_dose_responses.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

As the main feature of interest is the shape of the curve, UV action
spectra are usually normalized to an action that is equal to one at
300 nm. This is achieved, by dividing all the quantum (or photon)
effectiveness values measured at different wavelengths, by the
effectiveness at 300 nm. The use of $\lambda =300$ nm is an arbitrary
convention, of rather recent adoption, so you will find, especially in
the older literature, other wavelengths used for the normalization.

A response spectrum will rarely match the absorption spectrum of the
photoreceptor because of non-linearities in later steps between light
absorption by the photoreceptor and an observed response. In the case of
action spectra, by keeping the size of the response constant across
wavelengths we attempt to minimize the effect of these non-linearities
on the measured spectrum. Because of this, a properly measured action
spectrum will usually closely follow the absorption spectrum of the
pigment acting as photoreceptor, except from possible effect from
interfering pigments. Figure
[\[fig:action:spectra\]](#fig:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:action:spectra"} and Table
[\[tab:action:spectra\]](#tab:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:action:spectra"} show several action spectra relevant to
research on the effects of UV on plants. See the article by @Gorton2010
for a deeper discussion on biological action spectra.

### Constructing a polychromatic action spectrum {#sec:polychromatic:action:spectra}

Monochromatic action spectra are useful to understand the nature of a
specific response, e.g. damage, but are not suitable for calculating
real effects under solar radiation. The response of a plant to light and
UV radiation depends on both the amount of energy (dose-response) and
the spectral composition of the radiation. Polychromatic action
spectroscopy is based on a background of broad-band white light from
artificial sources or natural daylight supplemented by various
wavelength, for example between 280 and 360 nm [@Holmes1997]. This
polychromatic approach provides an action spectrum useful for assessing
effects of UV under normal plant growing conditions, because the
simultaneous exposure to a broad wavelength interval has a different net
effect than that of an exposure to separate monochromatic radiation, due
to synergisms or antagonisms between complex chemical and biological
processes, for example repair mechanisms [@Coohill1992; @madronich1993].
In practice, such a realistic polychromatic radiation spectrum is
achieved using a series of cut-off filters, which cut off radiation of
wavelengths shorter or longer than a certain wavelength. The effect of
such filters can be compared to the effect of the variable thickness of
the stratospheric ozone layer. Figure
[\[fig:Poly:Spectra\]](#fig:Poly:Spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Poly:Spectra"} shows examples of spectral irradiance for
broad band light from lamps filtered by different cut-off filters. The
cut-off wavelength usually refers to the wavelength of 50% transmission.

::: figure*
![image](figures/fig_polychrom.pdf){width="0.8\\myfigwidth"}
:::

The original approach, so called differential polychromatic action
spectroscopy, is described by @Rundel1983. Different biological
responses are proportional to different specific treatments, for example
exposures. Thus, an action spectrum can be estimated by quantifying
differences in responses between successive treatments. The number of
treatments required depends on the relative change in response over a
wavelength interval. One example of a quantifiable effect would be
change in the observed concentrations of flavonols.

#### The mathematics behind polychromatic action spectra {#app:polychromatic:math}

The average proportionality $\overline{s}$ between differences in the
biological effective response of successive treatments $i$,
$\Delta W_{be,i}$, and differences in exposure (fluence rate multiplied
by exposure time), $\Delta\exposure[i]$ is given by an average quantity
$$\overline{s_i} = \frac{\Delta W_{be,i}}{\Delta\exposure[i]}$$ All the
values of $\overline{s_i}$ together are represented in the action
spectrum. If the wavebands of each treatment are small enough, an action
spectrum $s(\lambda)$ can be expressed by a mathematical function.
Different functions are discussed [@Rundel1983; @Cullen1997]. In the
simplest case the factors $\overline{s_i}$ are positive and decrease
exponentially with increasing wavelength. Thus, one common form of
$s(\lambda)$ is
$$s(\lambda) = \mathrm{e}^{-k(\lambda-\lambda_0)} \label{Equ:BSWF:exp}$$
where $k$ is a parameter, which has to be obtained for each different
biological effect using a fitting procedure, and a wavelength
$\lambda_0$, where the action spectra are normalised to unity,
e.g. $\lambda_0=300$ nm. Other functions including a polynomial
dependence on $\lambda$ are also possible and perhaps necessary for
describing complex mechanisms.

For the interpretation of the experimental data, the biological
effective response $W_{be}$, it is necessary to consider the wavelength
dependency. Thus, it is crucial that the entire spectral irradiance
$\irr(\lambda,t)$ during the experiment is known. Broad-band meters are
not suitable in most cases. This dependency is included in the
biological effective dose function (exposure) $\exposure[be]$, given by

$$\begin{aligned}
\exposure[be] & = & \int_\lambda \int_t \enspace s(\lambda) \cdot \irr(\lambda,t) \enspace{\rm d}t\enspace{\rm d}\lambda \nonumber \\\nopagebreak
 & = & \int_\lambda \enspace s(\lambda) \cdot \exposure(\lambda) \enspace{\rm d}\lambda \label{Equ:Dose:be}
\end{aligned}$$ A mathematical model can separate wavelength and dose
dependency for a set of experimental data by the use of mathematical
functions describing $W_{be}(\exposure[be])$ and optimisation
procedures, e.g. non-linear curve fitting
[@Cullen1997; @Ghetti1999; @Ibdah2002; @goetz10]. The model assumes that
photons at different wavelengths act independently, but with different
quantum efficiency at the same absorption site, and therefore with the
same mechanism. Regarding the shape and saturation of the observed
effect, different functions can describe the data of $W_{be}(H_{be})$,
for example a linear, hyperbolic or sigmoid function. A simple linear
relation is
$$W_{be}(\exposure[be]) = W_0 \cdot \exposure[be] \label{Equ:Response:lin}$$
with the parameter $W_0$, which has to be determined by the fitting
procedure. If for example the exposure time of the radiation is constant
and, therefore, not depending on the duration of the experiment $t$, the
combination of
Eqs. [\[Equ:BSWF:exp\]](#Equ:BSWF:exp){reference-type="ref"
reference="Equ:BSWF:exp"} to
[\[Equ:Response:lin\]](#Equ:Response:lin){reference-type="ref"
reference="Equ:Response:lin"} yields
$$W_{be}(\exposure[be]) = W_0 \cdot t \cdot \int_\lambda \enspace \mathrm{e}^{-k(\lambda-\lambda_0)} \cdot \irr(\lambda) \enspace{\rm d}\lambda \label{Equ:Response:lin2}$$
To solve the equation for the unknown parameters $W_0$ and $k$,
measurements of the biological response $W_{be}$ and the spectral
irradiance $\irr(\lambda,t)$ have to be put into a fitting routine, to
optimise $W_0$ and $k$ by minimising the differences, e.g. the (root)
mean square, between measured and modelled values of $W_{be}$. In Figure
[\[fig:Poly:Spectra\]](#fig:Poly:Spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Poly:Spectra"} are six different scenarios shown. In this
case, the differences among six individual measured and modelled
responses have to be calculated and the sum of these needs to be
minimised by a non-linear optimisation technique, such as that provided
by the add-in "Solver\" in Excel.

### Action spectra in the field

Under field conditions it is more difficult to build UV action spectra,
and most frequently what are measured are polychromatic action spectra
[e.g. @Keiller2003; @Cooley2000a].

As many whole-plant responses result from a long signal transduction
chain, which depends on the action of more than one photoreceptor, the
action spectrum for many responses at the whole-plant or organ level,
seems to vary among species, with the seasons of the year or growing
conditions. For responses like these it is almost impossible to define a
unique and stable action spectrum for plants growing outdoors, as these
responses are too far decoupled from the photoreceptors.

Even if they do not faithfully reflect the properties of a single
photoreceptor, action spectra can be extremely useful, as we need them
as [BSWFs]{acronym-label="BSWF" acronym-form="plural+short"} (BSWFs)
when calculating biologically effective UV doses (see section
[\[sec:BSWFs:UVeff\]](#sec:BSWFs:UVeff){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:BSWFs:UVeff"} on page ), since the same UV radiation
spectrum has a different effect on different plant responses (Figure
[\[fig:action:spectra\]](#fig:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:action:spectra"}).

## Further reading {#sec:readings:intro}

<http://www.photobiology.info/>, photobiological sciences online. At
this web site there are many articles, several of them relevant to plant
photobiology. The book by @Bjorn2007 is a general introduction to
photobiology, that complements well this chapter. The mechanism of ozone
depletion and its consequences has been accessibly described by
@Graedel1993 in the book . The UNEP reports
[@unep2007; @unep2003; @UNEP2011 and earlier] provide up-to-date reviews
on the environmental consequences of stratospheric ozone depletion.

## Appendix: Calculation of polychromatic action spectra with Excel (using add-in "Solver") {#sec:appendix:polychromatic:action:spectra}

This is an example of one possibility to derive the parameters of a
polychromatic action spectrum by non-linear optimisation as explained in
section [1.8.2](#sec:polychromatic:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:polychromatic:action:spectra"} on page . The Excel add-in
"Solver" is listed in the menu "Tools". If this is not the case, it has
to be installed in `Tools>Add-Ins`. This experiment was performed in the
small sun simulator of the Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg,
Germany (see section
[\[sec:simulators\]](#sec:simulators){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:simulators"} at page ) in a special cuvette, which allows
simultaneous exposure of plants under different radiation
[@Ibdah2002; @goetz10]. Figure
[\[fig:Sosi:Cuvette\]](#fig:Sosi:Cuvette){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Sosi:Cuvette"} shows the cuvette placed in the sun
simulator with five rows of glass filters from Schott, Mainz, Germany
(WG295, WG305, WG320, WG335, WG360).

At the beginning we have to put all our measured data into different
sheets in Excel. In this example, the biological response $W_{be}$ is
the -induced flavonoid lutonarin (in $\mymu$mol g$^{-1}$ FW (fresh
weight)) of the first leaf of the barley cultivar "Barke". The amount
was estimated by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). Three
young plants in each of three independent experiments were harvested
under six different scenarios, which spectral irradiances are shown in
figure [\[fig:Poly:Spectra\]](#fig:Poly:Spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Poly:Spectra"} in section
[1.8.2](#sec:polychromatic:action:spectra){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:polychromatic:action:spectra"} on page . The data are put
into the first sheet "leaf data" and mean values and standard deviations
for each scenario were calculated as illustrated in figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet1\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet1"}).

:::

The second sheet "spectra" contains all measured spectra of the six
different scenarios under the glass filters. For the calculation of a
polychromatic action spectrum in the range it is recommended that the
spectrum is measured using a double-monochromator system from 280 to 400
nm in steps of 1 nm. In this experiment, the irradiance was increased
from the morning until noon and then decreased until the evening, to
simulate natural variation in solar radiation. This was done in four
steps as shown in the picture of the third sheet "daily exposure" in
figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet3\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet3){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet3"}. As an example, typical
radiation data under the glass filter WG305, measured during the
experiment, are presented in table
[\[tab:App:Poly:Spectra:UV-PAR\]](#tab:App:Poly:Spectra:UV-PAR){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:App:Poly:Spectra:UV-PAR"}. This sheet is only necessary
to calculate the exposure time at each light level in seconds as shown
in the marked cell F8. Sheet "spectra" contains the wavelengths in
column A and all the 24 spectra (six scenarios and four light levels)
from column B to Y.

Now all sheets for input data are finished and the sheets for solving
our system of equations has to be prepared. Therefore, the next sheet
"weighted spectra" is filled with the information about the action
spectrum function as shown in figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4"}. This sheet contains the
calculation of the biological effective dose function $H_{be}$ as
presented in equation
[\[Equ:Dose:be\]](#Equ:Dose:be){reference-type="ref"
reference="Equ:Dose:be"} on page . First, for the action spectrum
$s(\lambda)$ an exponential function in chosen, as explained for
equation [\[Equ:BSWF:exp\]](#Equ:BSWF:exp){reference-type="ref"
reference="Equ:BSWF:exp"} on page . Column A includes the wavelengths
and column B the estimated value of the action spectrum using the
parameter $\lambda_0=300$ nm of cell B4 and $k=0.200$ nm$^{-1}$ of cell
B5 (marked red in figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4"}). This cell is only a link to
cell B11 in the next sheet "SOLVER". Because it is only the starting
value of the optimisation procedure, the values of column B do not
represent the real action spectrum. These values will change during
optimisation. Below row 6, column D and the following columns (in this
case to column AA) include the values of the action spectrum of column B
multiplied by the spectral irradiances of each scenario and light levels
of sheet "spectra". Row 1 and 2 include the estimation of the doses. The
cells in row 2 from column D and the following columns represent the
integration over the wavelengths from 280 to 400 nm of each column
beneath multiplied by the exposure time of the respective scenario and
light level as previously calculated in the sheet "daily exposure".
Integration in Excel is done by adding the values of the cells regarding
the wavelength step as shown for the marked cell D2 in figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4"}. Here it is 1 nm. To get doses
in units of Ws m$^{-2}$ (J m$^{-2}$), the sum is divided by a factor of
1000 because the spectral irradiances were measured in mW m$^{-2}$
nm$^{-1}$. The daily dose (in kJ m$^{-2}$) is then calculated in row 1
for each scenario by adding the four values of the light levels. These
daily doses are now needed for further calculations in the next sheet
"SOLVER".

The sheet "SOLVER" as illustrated in figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solver0\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solver0){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solver0"} includes the comparison of the
measured and modelled data---as table and figure. The first five rows
are a short explanation of the entire model. Especially row 5 contains
the mathematical function describing the measured biological response
$W_{be}$, which was the flavonoid content of lutonarin in the first leaf
of barley. Here, a sigmoid function was chosen, given by
$$W_{be} = \frac{W_0}{1+\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\exposure[be]-\exposure[0]}{b}}} \label{Equ:Response:sigmoid}$$
Using this function, the values of each scenario of row 15 were
calculated. Therefore, the variable coefficients $W_0$, $\exposure[0]$,
$b$, and $k$ as well as their constraints from row 8 to 11 were used.
Row 14 includes the mean values of each treatment derived in the first
sheet "leaf data". The squared differences of measured and modelled data
are calculated in row 16 and added up in cell C17. All cells are now
prepared and we can start to optimise our variable coefficients by
minimising the value of cell C17. Thus, we mark this cell by clicking on
it and choose from the menu `Tools`$>$`Solver`. A new small window
called "Solver Parameters" will appear as shown in the left part of
figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam"}. Here, the target cell was
C17 and the box for minimisation was checked. The optimisation was done
by changing the cells B8 to B11 concerning all constraints listed in the
sheet. By clicking on the button "Options", another window will pop up,
where the parameters for the optimisation algorithm are defined (right
part of figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam"}). In this example, a
non-linear Newton method was used. The parameters of the upper left part
of the window define the number of iterations or the maximum time for
calculation as well as the precision or tolerance of the result. After
inserting the numbers and checking the necessary boxes, click "OK" to
return to the window "Solver Parameters". Here, the optimisation starts
by clicking on "Solve". After a while, the program returns a message if
the search succeeded and by accepting, the result is written into the
cells of sheet "SOLVER" chosen for changing.

The final result for the data in this example is shown in figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved"}. The sum of the squared
differences was minimised to 0.13. The left graph in the bottom of
figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved"} shows two bars for each
scenario, one for the measured leaf data of row 14 (yellow) and the
other one for the modelled data of row 15 (purple). The result looks
promising. The most important parameter regarding the action spectrum is
$k=0.126$ nm$^{-1}$ in cell B11. This value was used to plot the actual
action spectrum of this study in the upper right graph of figure
[\[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved\]](#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved"}. Our action spectrum is valid
for wavelengths between 280 and 400 nm, that interval which was chosen
for integration in sheet "weighted spectra".

This example describes just one possibility to solve a multi-variable
and non-linear problem. For example, there is also a plugin available
for Calc in OpenOffice.org. Therefore, if using Calc instead of Excel,
the file `NLPSolver.oxt`[^13] has to be installed by the extension
manager. Other search algorithms are used in this tool, but the result
will be the same.

[^11]: Different values of photon fluence can be obtained either by
    varying the irradiance, or the irradiation time. However, if the
    irradiation time is varied it is important to check that reciprocity
    holds. In other words, that the same fluence achieved through
    different irradiation times elicits the same size of response.

[^12]: Reciprocity refers to the assumption that equal values of photon
    fluence achieved by irradiation differing in length and photon
    irradiance, but supplying the same total number of photons, are
    expected to elicit an identical response.
