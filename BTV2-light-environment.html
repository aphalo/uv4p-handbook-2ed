<p>When dealing with solar radiation, we frequently need to describe the position of the sun. The azimuth angle (<span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>) is usually measured clockwise from the North on a horizontal plane. The position on the vertical plane is measured either as the zenith angle (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>) downwards from the zenith, or as an elevation angle (<span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>) upwards from the horizon. Consequently <span class="math inline">\(h + \theta = 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2}\,\)</span>radians. See Figure <a href="#fig:solar:position" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:solar:position">[fig:solar:position]</a> for a diagram. In contrast to Figure <a href="#fig_space" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig_space">[fig_space]</a> and the discussion in section <a href="#sec:radiation:properties" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:radiation:properties">1.3</a> where the point radiation source is located at the origin of the system of coordinates, when describing the position of the sun as in Figure <a href="#fig:solar:position" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:solar:position">[fig:solar:position]</a> the observer is situated at the origin.</p>

<p>Ultraviolet and visible radiation are part of solar radiation, which reaches the Earth’s surface in about eight minutes (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = time, <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span> = distance sun to earth, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> = velocity of light in vacuum): <span class="math display">\[t = \frac{r_0}{c} \approx \frac{150 \times 10^9 ~{\rm m}}{3 \times 10^8 ~\frac{\rm m}{\rm s}} = 500 ~{\rm s} = 8.3 ~{\rm min}\]</span> The basis of all passive measurements is the incoming solar radiation, which can be estimated from the known activity of the sun (‘productivity of photons’), that can be approximated by the emitted spectral radiance () described by Planck’s law of black body radiation at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, measured in degrees Kelvin (K): <span class="math display">\[%\radiance[s](\lambda,T) = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5}\cdot\frac{1}{\exp\left\{hc/k_BT\lambda\right\}-1} \label{equ_planck}
\radiance[s](\lambda,T) = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5}\cdot\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}^{(hc/k_\mathrm{B}T\lambda)}-1} \label{equ_planck}\]</span> with Boltzmann’s constant <span class="math inline">\(k_\mathrm{B}=1.381\times 10^{-23}\)</span> . The brightness temperature of the sun can be determined by Wien’s displacement law, which gives the peak wavelength of the radiation emitted by a blackbody as a function of its absolute temperature <span class="math display">\[\lambda_{max} \cdot T = 2.898 \times 10^6 \,{\rm nm\,K} \label{equ_wien}\]</span> This means that for a maximum emission of the sun at about 500 nm the temperature of the sun surface is about 5800 K. The spectral irradiance of the sun <span class="math inline">\(\irr[s](\lambda)\)</span> can be estimated assuming a homogeneous flux and using the correlation of intensity and radiance from their definitions in table <a href="#tab:Phys:Quants" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:Phys:Quants">[tab:Phys:Quants]</a>. The intensity of the sun <span class="math inline">\(\intensity[s](\lambda)\)</span> is given by the radiance <span class="math inline">\(\radiance[s](\lambda)\)</span> multiplied by the apparent sun surface (a non-tilted disk of radius <span class="math inline">\(r_s=7\times 10^5\)</span> km). To calculate the decreased solar irradiance at the moment of reaching the Earth’s atmosphere, the distance of the sun to the Earth (<span class="math inline">\(r_0=150\times 10^6\)</span> km) has to be taken into account due to the inverse square law of irradiance of equation (<a href="#equ_r2law" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="equ_r2law">[equ_r2law]</a>). Thus, the extraterrestrial solar irradiance is <span class="math display">\[\irr[s](\lambda)=\radiance[s](\lambda)\cdot\frac{\pi r_s^2}{r_0^2}\label{equ_extraterrestrial}\]</span> Remembering the solid angle of equation (<a href="#equ_solidangle" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="equ_solidangle">[equ_solidangle]</a>), the right multiplication factor represents the solid angle of the sun’s disk as seen from the Earth’s surface (<span class="math inline">\(\approx 6.8\times 10^{-5}\)</span> sr). Figure <a href="#fig_sun" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig_sun">[fig_sun]</a> shows the spectrum of the measured extraterrestrial solar radiation (Wehrli, 1985)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and the spectrum calculated by equation 1.14 using Planck’s law of equation 1.12 at a black body temperature of 5800&nbsp;K. Integrated over all wavelengths, <span class="math inline">\(\irr[s]\)</span> is about 1361 to 1362 at top of the atmosphere <span class="citation" data-cites="Kopp2011">[@Kopp2011]</span>. This value is called the ‘solar constant’. In former times, depending on different measurements, <span class="math inline">\(\irr[s]\)</span> varies by a few percent <span class="citation" data-cites="iqbal83">[@iqbal83]</span>. For example, the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere (the integrated value) changes by <span class="math inline">\(\pm 50\)</span> (3.7 %) during the year due to distance variation caused by orbit excentricity <span class="citation" data-cites="moble94">[@moble94]</span>. More accurate measurements during the last 25 years by spaceborne radiometers show a variability of the solar radiation of a few tenth of a percent. A detailed analysis is given by <span class="citation" data-cites="froeh04">@froeh04</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\irr[s]\)</span> can also be calculated by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: the total energy emitted from the surface of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. For an isotropically emitting source (Lambertian emitter), this means <span class="math display">\[\radiance = \frac{\sigma}{\pi} \cdot T^4 \label{equ_boltzmann}\]</span> with the Stefan-Boltzmann constant <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=5.6705\times 10^{-8}\)</span> W m<span class="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span> K<span class="math inline">\(^{-4}\)</span>. With <span class="math inline">\(T = 5800\)</span>&nbsp;K equation <a href="#equ_boltzmann" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="equ_boltzmann">[equ_boltzmann]</a> gives the radiance of the solar disc. From this value, we can obtain an approximation of the solar constant, by taking into account the distance from the Earth to the Sun and the apparent size of the solar disc (see equations <a href="#equ_solidangle" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="equ_solidangle">[equ_solidangle]</a> and <a href="#equ_r2law" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="equ_r2law">[equ_r2law]</a>).</p>

<p>The extraterrestrial solar spectrum differs from that at ground level due to the absorption of radiation by the atmosphere, because the absorption peaks of water, and other components of the atmosphere, cause corresponding valleys to appear in the solar spectrum at ground level. For example, estimates from measurements of the total global irradiance at Helmholtz Zentrum München (11.60<span class="math inline">\(\degree\)</span> E, 48.22<span class="math inline">\(\degree\)</span> N, 490 m above sea level) on two sunny days (17<span class="math inline">\(^{\rm th}\)</span> April 1996, sun zenith angle of 38<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> and 27<span class="math inline">\(^{\rm th}\)</span> May 2005, 27<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>) result in about 5% for wavelengths below 400 nm, about 45% from 400 to 700&nbsp;nm, and about 50% above 700&nbsp;nm. In relation to plant research, only the coarse structure of peaks and valleys is relevant, because absorption spectra of pigments <em>in vivo</em> have broad peaks and valleys. However, the solar spectrum has a much finer structure, due to emission and absorption lines of elements, which is not observable with the spectroradiometers normally used in plant research.</p>
<p>At the Earth’s surface, the incident radiation or <span data-acronym-label="global:rad" data-acronym-form="singular+short"><em>global:rad</em></span> has two components, <span data-acronym-label="direct:rad" data-acronym-form="singular+short">direct:rad</span> and <span data-acronym-label="diffuse:rad" data-acronym-form="singular+short">diffuse:rad</span>. Direct radiation is radiation travelling directly from the sun, while diffuse radiation is that scattered by the atmosphere. Diffuse radiation is what gives the blue colour to the sky and white colour to clouds. The relative contribution of direct and diffuse radiation to global radiation varies with wavelength and weather conditions. The contribution of diffuse radiation is larger in the UV region, and in the presence of clouds (Figures <a href="#fig:sky:photos" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:sky:photos">[fig:sky:photos]</a> and <a href="#fig:diffuse:UV" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:diffuse:UV">[fig:diffuse:UV]</a>).</p>

<p>Not only total irradiance, but also the wavelength distribution of the solar spectrum changes with the seasons of the year and time of day. The spectral wavelength distribution is also changed by the amount of -absorbing ozone in the atmosphere, known as the ozone column. Figure <a href="#fig:solar:spectra:one:day" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:solar:spectra:one:day">[fig:solar:spectra:one:day]</a> shows how spectral irradiance changes throughout one day. When the whole spectrum is plotted using a linear scale the effect of ozone depletion is not visible, however, if we plot only the region (Figure <a href="#fig:solarUV:spectrum:noon" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:solarUV:spectrum:noon">[fig:solarUV:spectrum:noon]</a>) or use a logarithmic scale (Figure <a href="#fig:solar:spectra:one:day:log" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:solar:spectra:one:day:log">[fig:solar:spectra:one:day:log]</a>), the effect becomes clearly visible. In addition, on a log scale, it is clear that the relative effect of ozone depletion on the spectral irradiance at a given wavelength increases with decreasing wavelength.</p>

<p>Seasonal variation in irradiance has a larger relative amplitude than variation in (Figure <a href="#fig:diffuse.light" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:diffuse.light">[fig:diffuse.light]</a>). This causes a seasonal variation in the : ratio (Figure <a href="#fig:UVB:Erlangen" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:UVB:Erlangen">[fig:UVB:Erlangen]</a>). In addition to the regular seasonal variation, there is random variation as a result of changes in clouds (Figure <a href="#fig:UVB:Erlangen" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:UVB:Erlangen">[fig:UVB:Erlangen]</a>). Normal seasonal and spatial variation in can be sensed by plants, and could play a role in their adaptation to seasons and/or their position in the canopy.</p>

<p>An increase in the irradiance is caused by depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere, mainly as a consequence of the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in cooling devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners, and in some spray cans <span class="citation" data-cites="Graedel1993">[see @Graedel1993]</span>. The most dramatic manifestation of this has been the seasonal formation of an “ozone hole” over Antarctica. It is controversial whether a true ozone hole has already formed in the Arctic, but strong depletion has occurred in year 2011 <span class="citation" data-cites="Manney2011">[@Manney2011]</span> and atmospheric conditions needed for the formation of a “deep” ozone hole are not very different from those prevalent in recent years. Not so dramatic, but consistent, depletion has also been observed at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. CFCs and some other halocarbons have been phased out following the Montreal agreement and later updates. However, as CFCs have a long half life in the atmosphere, of the order of 100 years, their effect on the ozone layer will persist for many years, even after their use has been drastically reduced. Model-based predictions of changes in atmospheric circulation due to global climate change have been used to derive future trends in index and ozone column thickness <span class="citation" data-cites="Hegglin2009">[@Hegglin2009]</span>. In addition, increased cloudiness and pollution, could lead to decreased and , sometimes called ‘global dimming’ <span class="citation" data-cites="Stanhill2001">[e.g. @Stanhill2001]</span>. It should be noted that, through reflection, broken clouds can locally increase irradiance to values above those under clear-sky conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="Frederick1993 Diaz1996">[@Frederick1993; @Diaz1996]</span>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="uv-radiation-within-plant-canopies">UV radiation within plant canopies</h2>
<p>The attenuation of visible and radiation by canopies is difficult to describe mathematically because it is a complex phenomenon. The spatial distribution of leaves is in most cases not uniform, the display angle of the leaves is not random, and may change with depth in the canopy, and even in some cases with time-of-day. Here we give only a description of the simplest approach, the use of an approximation based on Beer’s law as modified by <span class="citation" data-cites="Monsi1953">@Monsi1953</span>, reviewed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Hirose2005">@Hirose2005</span>. Beer’s law (Equation <a href="#eq:Beer-Lambert" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:Beer-Lambert">[eq:Beer-Lambert]</a>) assumes a homogeneous light absorbing medium such as a solution. However, a canopy is heterogenous, with discrete light absorbing objects (the leaves and stems) distributed in a transparent medium (air). <span class="math display">\[I_z = I_0\cdot\mathrm{e}^{-K\,L_z} \label{eq:Monsi:Saeki}\]</span> Equation <a href="#eq:Monsi:Saeki" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:Monsi:Saeki">[eq:Monsi:Saeki]</a> describes the radiation attenuated as a function of leaf area index (<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> or ) at a given canopy depth (<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>). The equation does not explicitly account for the effects of the statistical spatial distribution of leaves and the effects of changing incidence angle of the radiation. Consequently, the empirical extinction coefficient (<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>) obtained may vary depending on these factors. <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is not only a function of plant species (through leaf optical properties, and how leaves are displayed), but also of time-of-day, and season-of-year—as a consequence of solar zenith angle—and degree of scattering of the incident radiation. As the degree of scattering depends on clouds, and also on wavelength, the extinction coefficient is different for and visible radiation. Radiation extinction in canopies has yet to be studied in detail with respect to radiation, mainly because of difficulties in the measurement of radiation compared to , a spectral region which has been extensively studied.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet radiation is strongly absorbed by plant surfaces, although cuticular waxes and pubescence on leaves can sometimes increase reflectance. The diffuse component of radiation is larger than that of visible light (Figure <a href="#fig:diffuse.light" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:diffuse.light">[fig:diffuse.light]</a>). In sunlit patches in forest gaps the diffuse radiation percentage is lower than in open areas, because <span data-acronym-label="direct:rad" data-acronym-form="singular+short">direct:rad</span> is not attenuated but part of the sky is occluded by the surrounding forest. Attenuation with canopy depth is on average usually more gradual for than for . The irradiance decreases with depth in tree canopies, but the ratio tends to increase <span class="citation" data-cites="Brown1994">[see @Brown1994]</span>. In contrast, <span class="citation" data-cites="Deckmyn2001">@Deckmyn2001</span> observed a decrease in ratio in white clover canopies with planophyle leaves. <span class="citation" data-cites="Allen1975">@Allen1975</span> modelled the penetration in plant canopies, under normal and depleted ozone conditions. <span class="citation" data-cites="Parisi1996">@Parisi1996</span> measured doses within model plant canopies using dosimeters. The position of leaves affects exposure, and it has been observed that heliotropism can moderate exposure and could be a factor contributing to differences in tolerance among crop cultivars <span class="citation" data-cites="Grant1998 Grant1999 Grant1999a Grant2004">[@Grant1998; @Grant1999; @Grant1999a; @Grant2004]</span>.</p>

<p>As solar radiation passes through a body of water, its spectrum changes with depth in a wavelength-dependent manner, determined by the optical characteristics of that water body. The penetration of UV radiation through water bodies can vary from only few centimetres in highly humic lakes <span class="citation" data-cites="Kirk1994 Kirk1994b Huovinen2003">[@Kirk1994; @Kirk1994b; @Huovinen2003]</span> to dozens of metres in the oceans <span class="citation" data-cites="Smith1992 Kirk1994 Kirk1994b">[@Smith1992; @Kirk1994; @Kirk1994b]</span>. Some irradiance is reflected at the water surface, but the extent to which wavelengths in the UV to IR range penetrate water bodies depends mainly on (1) attenuation by water itself, (2) coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and seston. Seston is the sum of living organic material (mainly phytoplankton) and non-living material (tripton). Non-living particles are further distinguished between organic material (detritus) and inorganic suspended matter. Each fraction has its own characteristic spectral absorption and scattering properties <span class="citation" data-cites="dekke93 Kirk1994 Kirk1994b Hargreaves2003 Wozniak2007">[reviewed by @dekke93; @Kirk1994; @Kirk1994b; @Hargreaves2003; @Wozniak2007]</span>.</p>
<p>Particularly in coastal areas and shallow areas of lakes and streams, irradiance reflected from the ground or sea-bed beneath the water (henceforth bottom) influences the profile of radiation through the aquatic environment. This reflectance is described by a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which is wavelength specific and depends on the incident and reflected angle. If the reflectance is equally distributed in all directions, the bottom is a so called Lambertian reflector and the BRDF is constant. The bottom reflectance is greatly influenced by its slope and properties, i.e.&nbsp;whether the bottom is bare sediment or covered by algae and submersed vegetation <span class="citation" data-cites="marit94 alber03 moble03a moble03b pinne07">[e.g. @marit94; @alber03; @moble03a; @moble03b; @pinne07]</span>.</p>

<p>The refraction of incoming (downwelling) radiance at the water surface can be determined by Snell’s law, which describes the angular refraction of the incident beam. The radiation passes the first medium with a refractive index <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> and then the second medium with a refractive index <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span>. If the incoming direction of the radiation is given by the angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>, the beam is refracted to the angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span>. Snell’s law is <span class="math display">\[n_1 \cdot \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \cdot \sin\theta_2\]</span> For the case of radiation arriving from the air under the incident angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span> and going into the water with the transmitted angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta_t\)</span>, this yields a refractive index for the air of <span class="math inline">\(n_a=1\)</span> and for the water of <span class="math inline">\(n_W=1.33\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\theta_t = \arcsin \left( 0.75\cdot \sin\theta_i \right)\]</span></p>
<p>Theoretically, <span class="math inline">\(n_W\)</span> is not constant but depends on temperature, wavelength and salinity, as described by <span class="citation" data-cites="quanx95">@quanx95</span>. In principle, the shorter the wavelength, the higher the refractive index of water, but in practice the wavelength-dependent difference in refraction is unimportant. For example comparing the values at 400 and 800 nm for 20and no salinity produces a difference of <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> 0.5%. If the wind speed is high, the slope of surface waves also has to be taken into account. A rough surface reflects and transmits the incoming radiation beam in more directions and makes the radiation field more diffuse than a smooth surface.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="absorption-and-scattering-by-pure-water">Absorption and scattering by pure water</h3>
<p>Water itself absorbs and scatters radiation. The optical properties of the water in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectrum are not precisely known, since no theoretical model exists which exactly describes the absorption and scattering properties of pure water. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on laboratory measurements to approximate the values of these parameters. Investigations into absorption by water <span class="math inline">\(a_W\)</span> were initially documented by <span class="citation" data-cites="morel74">@morel74</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="smith76">@smith76</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="smith81">@smith81</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="pegau93">@pegau93</span> and more recently by <span class="citation" data-cites="buite94">@buite94</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="hakvo94">@hakvo94</span>. The absorption properties of water also depend on temperature. The influence of temperature is weak below 700&nbsp;nm, but its effect increases with increasing wavelength; so, for example, a temperature increase of 10&nbsp;K produces a <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span><!-- -->7% change in the absolute value of <span class="math inline">\(a_W\)</span> at 740&nbsp;nm.</p>
<p>The scattering of radiation by molecules in liquids has been modelled theoretically by <span class="citation" data-cites="smolu08">@smolu08</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="einst10">@einst10</span>. This approach is based on statistical thermodynamics and is called the theory of fluctuation. Theoretically, the scattering function is wavelength-dependent and follows the <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{-4}\)</span> law. Experiments show a slight deviation from the model, giving a better correlation with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{-4.32}\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="morel74">[@morel74]</span> due to the effects of isothermal compressibility, the refractive index of water, and the pressure derivative of the refractive index of water <span class="citation" data-cites="hakvo94">[@hakvo94]</span>.</p>
<p>The wavelength dependency of the absorption and scattering coefficients of pure water are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:Water:Abs_Scat" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:Water:Abs_Scat">[fig:Water:Abs_Scat]</a> using data from <span class="citation" data-cites="hakvo94">@hakvo94</span>.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="absorption-and-scattering-by-water-constituents">Absorption and scattering by water constituents</h3>
<p>Absorption and scattering by water constituents is the sum of (1) absorption by CDOM, sometimes also called yellow or humic substances, gilvin or gelbstoff, (2) absorption and scattering by living material like phytoplankton, and (3) absorption and scattering by dead organic and inorganic particles. The influence of each constituent on the scattering process depends on wavelength, particle size, concentration, and refractive index. Theoretical details are explained in, for example, <span class="citation" data-cites="vhuls81">@vhuls81</span>.</p>
<p>CDOM mainly refers to coloured dissolved humic materials and consists of humic and fulvic acids, originating from decomposed plant material suspended in the water or entering from the surrounding catchment area. The pigments in humic and fulvic acids absorb strongly in the blue and UV wavelengths and are dissolved and therefore do not scatter irradiance. <span class="citation" data-cites="kalle66">@kalle66</span> recognised that CDOM absorption decreases exponentially with increasing wavelength in the visible part of the spectra. Following the study of <span class="citation" data-cites="morel76">@morel76</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="brica81">@brica81</span> expressed this relationship in the following model: for a known absorption at a wavelength <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_0=440\)</span>&nbsp;nm, the CDOM absorption <span class="math inline">\(a_Y\)</span> can be determined by <span class="math display">\[a_Y(\lambda) = a_Y(\lambda_0)\cdot {\rm e}^{-s_Y(\lambda-\lambda_0)} \label{equ_ay}\]</span> Although the exponential coefficient <span class="math inline">\(s_Y\)</span> is variable, a standard value of <span class="math inline">\(s_Y=0.014\)</span> nm<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> is commonly used. <span class="citation" data-cites="brica81">@brica81</span> compared the value of <span class="math inline">\(s_Y\)</span> across many data sets and reported a standard deviation of only <span class="math inline">\(\Delta s_Y=\pm 0.003\)</span> nm<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>. The amount of CDOM in water is determined by filtration using membrane filters of 0.2 <span class="math inline">\(\mymu\)</span>m pore size. The filtrate is collected into a quartz cuvette with length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and put into a (double beam) spectrophotometer to measure its <span data-acronym-label="absorbance" data-acronym-form="singular+short">absorbance</span> (optical density) <span class="math inline">\(A(\lambda)\)</span>. Then, <span class="math inline">\(a_Y(\lambda)=2.303\cdot\frac{A(\lambda)}{l}\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Kirk1994">[@Kirk1994]</span>. The absorption coefficient at 440 nm has been used as an indication of optical colour <span class="citation" data-cites="Kirk1994">[@Kirk1994]</span>, while size of humic molecules has been estimated from the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a_Y(\lambda=250{\rm nm})}{a_Y(\lambda={\rm 365 nm})}\)</span>, with increasing size indicated by smaller ratios <span class="citation" data-cites="DeHaan1972 DeHaan1987 DeHaan1993">[@DeHaan1972; @DeHaan1987; @DeHaan1993]</span>. To determine <span class="math inline">\(a_Y\)</span> from clearer (e.g.&nbsp;oceanic) waters, a cuvette with a 10&nbsp;cm path-length is generally needed due to their low values of absorption.</p>
<p>Phytoplankton can contribute to the attenuation of PAR through absorption by their photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll and pheophytin, but they can also cause scattering. The absorption by phytoplankton <span class="math inline">\(a_P\)</span> is the sum of absorption by each pigment multiplied each by their concentrations. Due to the fact that many species of phytoplankton occur in aquatic environments and every species contains more than one pigment, it is more practicable to calculate the absorption by mean specific absorption coefficients for each different algal species separately. This has been done by <span class="citation" data-cites="gegep98">@gegep98</span> for freshwater Lake Constance in Germany and by <span class="citation" data-cites="prieu81">@prieu81</span> for an oceanic environment. Besides these examples, there are other models for oceanic waters that use the specific <em>in vivo</em> absorption coefficient and concentration of chlorophyll-<em>a</em>, <span class="math inline">\(a_{chl}^*\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_{chl}\)</span>, respectively. <span class="citation" data-cites="morel91">@morel91</span> found that the power law <span class="math inline">\(a_P = 0.06\, a_{chl}^*\, [C_{chl}]^{0.65}\)</span>, which was first proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="prieu81">@prieu81</span>, provided the best estimate of the absorption coefficient for his data set. <span class="math inline">\(C_{chl}\)</span> is the concentration of chlorophyll-<em>a</em> in units of <span class="math inline">\(\mymu\)</span>g l<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>.

The empirical model of <span class="citation" data-cites="brica95">@brica95</span> parameterises the specific absorption coefficient from <span class="math inline">\(C_{chl}\)</span>. This model draws on extensive studies of more than 800 spectra to give <span class="math inline">\(a_P^*(\lambda) = A(\lambda)[C_{chl}]^{-B(\lambda)}\)</span> with positive empirical coefficients <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> depending on wavelength. The model incorporates both the package effect of phytoplankton cells and the effect of the varying pigment composition on absorption.</p>
<p>The particulate structure of phytoplankton cells causes scattering. The influence of phytoplankton on the total scattering coefficient depends on the other constituents of the water body. For water containing a low concentration of inorganic suspended sediment scattering is driven by the concentration of phytoplankton (as occurs in the open ocean). <span class="citation" data-cites="gordo83">@gordo83</span> developed an empirical model, which directly correlates scattering with the pigment concentration of chlorophyll-<em>a</em> <span class="math inline">\(C_{chl}\)</span> in units of <span class="math inline">\(\mymu\)</span>g l<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>. The scattering coefficient of phytoplankton <span class="math inline">\(b_P\)</span> in units of m<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[b_P(\lambda) = B \cdot [C_{chl}]^{0.62} \cdot \left(\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda}\right) \label{equ_bp_emp}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_0=550\)</span> nm and <span class="math inline">\(B=0.3\)</span> as mean values for oceanic waters dominated by phytoplankton. The equation (<a href="#equ_bp_emp" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="equ_bp_emp">[equ_bp_emp]</a>) is valid for a range of phytoplankton concentrations from 0.05 to 1&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\mymu\)</span>g l<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="gordo83">@gordo83</span> found that oceanic waters have a value of <span class="math inline">\(B\le 0.45\)</span>. Higher values are used for other aquatic environments, for example turbid coastal waters. In coastal regions, <span class="citation" data-cites="sathy89">@sathy89</span> proposed that the scattering coefficient is indirectly proportional to absorption by phytoplankton: <span class="math inline">\(b_P(\lambda) \propto 1/a_P(\lambda)\)</span>. The proportionality factor depends on the concentration of chlorophyll-<em>a</em> in the same manner as the scattering coefficient of equation (<a href="#equ_bp_emp" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="equ_bp_emp">[equ_bp_emp]</a>). <span class="citation" data-cites="dekke93">@dekke93</span> investigated the contribution to scattering of each water constituent in inland waters<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. He found that the composition of scattering particles was more variable in inland waters than in the ocean and it depended on the trophic state of the water and therefore on the distribution of organic and inorganic particulate matter. The scattering and backscattering coefficient of phytoplankton can be determined by <span class="math inline">\(b_P(\lambda)=b_P^*(\lambda) \cdot C_P\)</span> where the specific scattering coefficient of phytoplankton is <span class="math inline">\(b_P^*\)</span>.

<p>Particulate matter in water bodies consists of organic and inorganic material. The organic constituents are contained in phytoplankton cells or are fragments of dead plankton and faecal pellets of zooplankton. These parts are often called detritus. Inorganic particles include suspended mineral coming from inflows or resuspension at coastal regions. They mainly consist of quartz, clay, and calcite. There are only a few published values of the specific absorption coefficients of suspended particles in water from aquatic environments because they are difficult to separate into their individual constituent parts. A comparison of these values is given by <span class="citation" data-cites="pozdn03">@pozdn03</span>. In general, absorption by all suspended particles in most water bodies is very low and it is negligible for inorganic particles. <span class="citation" data-cites="roesl89">@roesl89</span> produced the following relationship for absorption by detritus in coastal waters which is very similar that of CDOM: <span class="math display">\[a_X(\lambda) = a_X(\lambda_0) \cdot {\rm e}^{-s_X(\lambda-\lambda_0)} \label{equ_adet}\]</span> with a mean value of <span class="math inline">\(s_X=0.011\)</span> nm<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_X(\lambda_0)=0.09\)</span> m<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_0=400\)</span> nm for their data. Particulate matter in general causes more scattering of irradiance than it absorbs. In coastal waters and freshwater, scattering is higher than in oceanic waters due to the additional presence of particles not related to phytoplankton. These particles come from suspended inorganic sediments of different sizes. Scattering is caused by differences in the refractive indices of the two materials (the water medium and the material of the particles) and are due to the ratio of particle size to wavelength. Different functions of scattering coefficients and phase functions are, for example, described by <span class="citation" data-cites="moble94">@moble94</span>. Especially turbid and coastal waters, or rivers and lakes, are dominated by large particles (<span class="math inline">\(&gt;1\)</span>&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\mymu\)</span>m and a refraction index of 1.03). Therefore, the scattering coefficient of non-living particles <span class="math inline">\(b_X\)</span> can be estimated while neglecting their size distribution and wavelength dependence. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(b_X\)</span> is derived from <span class="math inline">\(b_X(\lambda) = b_X^* \cdot C_X\)</span>, with the concentration of the total suspended matter <span class="math inline">\(C_X\)</span> and the specific scattering coefficients <span class="math inline">\(b_X^*\)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="dekke93">@dekke93</span> gave example specific scattering coefficients of 0.23 to 0.79&nbsp;m<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> g<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> for different trophic states in lakes.</p>

<p>In summary, after considering all the components that absorb radiation, in very clear non-productive oceanic waters blue-green wavelengths in the PAR spectrum dominate, whereas in highly-coloured, humic inland waters blue wavelengths are rapidly attenuated. In humic lakes, CDOM largely governs UV attenuation <span class="citation" data-cites="Kirk1994 Kirk1994b Scully1994 Huovinen2003">[e.g. @Kirk1994; @Kirk1994b; @Scully1994; @Huovinen2003]</span>), whereas in oceans <span class="citation" data-cites="Smith1979">[@Smith1979]</span> and clear lakes containing low CDOM concentrations the contribution of phytoplankton to UV attenuation can be significant <span class="citation" data-cites="Sommaruga1997">[@Sommaruga1997]</span>. If very turbid water contains a large amount of inorganic particles, CDOM is bonded by calcium carbonate contained in the particles, and consequently the colour of the water returns to blue.</p>
<p>There is marked variation in the penetration of UV radiation among water bodies, and within a water body during the year. Global changes, such as climate warming and acidification <span class="citation" data-cites="Schindler1996 Yan1996 Donahue1998">[@Schindler1996; @Yan1996; @Donahue1998]</span> can lead to increased underwater UV penetration, likewise UV-B radiation itself which can positively affect its own penetration through the photodegradation of CDOM <span class="citation" data-cites="Morris1997">[@Morris1997]</span>. Variation in the absorption properties of dissolved organic compounds with the seasons and according to their origin and molecular weight <span class="citation" data-cites="Stewart1980 Hessen1998 Lean1998">[@Stewart1980; @Hessen1998; @Lean1998]</span>, interferes with our estimation of UV penetration based on CDOM concentrations. Temporal changes in the absorption characteristics of CDOM have also been reported, with fresh CDOM being photochemically more active than older CDOM <span class="citation" data-cites="Lean1998">[@Lean1998]</span>. It is also notable that UV radiation has been shown to penetrate deeper in saline prairie lakes than in fresh waters of corresponding CDOM concentrations <span class="citation" data-cites="Arts2000">[@Arts2000]</span>.</p>
<p>Estimations of CDOM are relatively easy to perform and therefore often used for <em>in situ</em> and remote sensing measurements of optical properties. However, another parameter called dissolved organic carbon (DOC, in units of mg l<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>) is also useful to measure, since it is more interpretable for studies of carbon cycling and in the context of global change research. <span class="citation" data-cites="kowal10">@kowal10</span>, report that CDOM contributes approximately 20% to the total DOC pool in the open ocean and up to 70% in coastal areas. Unfortunately, on a global scale it has not yet been possible to make a direct link between CDOM and DOC due to the heterogeneous organic composition of CDOM. Until that connection is made, estimation of the universal bulk carbon-specific CDOM absorption coefficient, defined as the ratio of CDOM absorption to DOC concentration, remains almost impossible <span class="citation" data-cites="Wozniak2007">[@Wozniak2007]</span>, but at least there are good correlations between <span class="math inline">\(a_Y\)</span> and DOC concentrations in coastal areas <span class="citation" data-cites="kowal10">[@kowal10]</span>.</p>
<p>Aquatic organisms can be affected not only directly but also indirectly through UV-dependent changes in the surrounding water, e.g.&nbsp;through increased formation of photochemical reaction products such as singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Especially in lakes with low DOC concentrations, photoenhanced toxicity of some environmental contaminants or release of complexed metals into the water can occur due to the photodegradation of organic matter <span class="citation" data-cites="Zepp1982 Palenik1991 Hessen1994 Arfsten1996 Scully1997">[@Zepp1982; @Palenik1991; @Hessen1994; @Arfsten1996; @Scully1997]</span>. Despite the potential for detrimental effects, the final impact of UV radiation on organisms may be mitigated by their protective and repair mechanisms <span class="citation" data-cites="Karentz1991 Mitchell1993 Vincent1993">[@Karentz1991; @Mitchell1993; @Vincent1993]</span>, which somehow also depend on certain wavelengths of irradiation. When evaluating the exposure of seaweeds to UV radiation, it should be taken into account that other factors, such as kelp canopies, can markedly reduce the PAR and UV radiation reaching their understorey. Furthermore, the underwater radiation received by seaweeds can be significantly altered depending on the tidal range <span class="citation" data-cites="Huovinen2011">[@Huovinen2011]</span>. Phenolic compounds released from large brown algae into the surrounding water can also locally attenuate UV radiation.</p>
<p>Classifications of water bodies based on their optical characteristics have been developed as general tools in order to allow comparisons between different water bodies. <span class="citation" data-cites="Jerlov1976">@Jerlov1976</span> traditional and widely-used classification of marine waters, based on their transmittance of irradiance at different wavelengths, recognizes three oceanic (I–III) and nine coastal (1–9) types of water body (Figure <a href="#fig:Jerlov" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:Jerlov">[fig:Jerlov]</a>). <span class="citation" data-cites="Morel1977">@Morel1977</span> classified ocean waters into two types based on their optically dominant components: (i) phytoplankton and their products dominate case-i waters, (ii) particles and dissolved coloured material dominate case-ii waters. The classification proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Kirk1980">@Kirk1980</span> is principally suited to inland waters and is based on the spectral absorption of the soluble and particulate fractions. <span class="citation" data-cites="Kirk1980">@Kirk1980</span> defined type G waters, in which CDOM is the dominant light-absorbing component, compared with type T, W and A waters, where tripton, water itself and phytoplankton dominate respectively. Beyond these scales, various other optical classifications have also been proposed <span class="citation" data-cites="Kirk1994 Hargreaves2003">[reviewed by @Kirk1994; @Hargreaves2003]</span>.</p>

Another useful relationship between irradiance and fluence rate can be obtained using the Gershun equation: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\rm d}{{\rm d}z} E(z,\lambda) = -a \, E_0(z,\lambda) \label{equ_gershun}\]</span> If, for example, only the downwelling irradiance <span class="math inline">\(E_d(z,\lambda)\)</span> is measured or necessary for calculating radiative transfer, Equation <a href="#equ_dbeer" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="equ_dbeer">[equ_dbeer]</a> yields <span class="math display">\[\frac{{\rm d}E_d(z,\lambda)}{{\rm d}z} = -K_d\cdot E_d(z,\lambda) \label{equ_downirr}\]</span> giving the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance, <span class="math inline">\(K_d\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(K_d\)</span> is related to the total absorption <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and scattering <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> as well as to <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and also the solar zenith angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta_s\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="kirkj91 alber03">[@kirkj91; @alber03]</span>. A practical and often-used method to estimate <span class="math inline">\(K_d\)</span>, and therefore the transparency of the water, is the Secchi disk test. The visibility of a submerged white disk can be correlated to downwelling diffuse attenuation <span class="citation" data-cites="tyler68">[@tyler68]</span>. This and also the penetration depth <span class="math inline">\(z_d\)</span> give useful information about the water body. The penetration of irradiance important for photosynthesis (primary production) is often expressed as the depth at which, for example, 1% or 10% of the value just below the water surface is reached. The depth, where 1% of PAR is reached, separates the euphotic zone from the aphotic zone. After <span class="citation" data-cites="Kirk1994">@Kirk1994</span>, <span class="math inline">\(z_d\)</span> can be obtained from <span class="math inline">\(K_d\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(z_d(1\%) = 4.6/K_d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_d(10\%) = 2.3/K_d\)</span>. In Figure <a href="#fig:Valdivia" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:Valdivia">[fig:Valdivia]</a>, an example of spectral attenuation of solar radiation at different depths, as well as the penetration depths of UV-B, UV-A radiation and PAR are given for coastal waters of the south-eastern Pacific Ocean (off the coast of Chile).</p>
<p>A very useful tool to simulate spectral radiance and irradiance under water, depending on different concentrations of the water constituents or bottom depth and type, is called WASI (water colour simulator, <span class="citation" data-cites="gegep04">[@gegep04]</span>). The software includes different analytical parameterisations and it can also be used for inverse calculations, i.e.&nbsp;for estimating optical properties and concentrations of water constituents from (remote sensing) measurements.

<p>Many studies have indicated that UV-absorbing compounds in the vacuoles of epidermal cells have a major role in regulating internal UV levels. However, absorbing compounds located in cell walls and other cell parts can also be important in controlling internal UV penetration. These compounds are usually not easily extractable, and consequently one cannot rely on extracts alone when judging the effectiveness of UV-screening protection. Furthermore, both wax deposits and pubescence may be very important for protection against ultraviolet radiation <span class="citation" data-cites="Karabourniotis1999 Holmes2002">[@Karabourniotis1999; @Holmes2002]</span>.

<section id="sec:action:spectra" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:action:spectra">Action and response spectra</h2>
<p>Plants do not respond equally to all wavelengths of , and this spectral response can be described by a response spectrum and/or by an action spectrum. It is important to be aware that an action spectrum is not the same thing as a response spectrum. Although they are both used to describe the wavelength dependency of a biological response to radiation they are measured and used differently. Because they are measured in different ways they yield curves of different shapes. A response spectrum shows the size of the response at a <em>fixed photon fluence</em><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> of radiation across a series of different wavelengths. However, since UV radiation never comes at fixed irradiances over the entire spectrum the response spectrum is of limited use when estimating the physiological response to solar- or broadband UV exposure. In contrast, an action spectrum shows the effectiveness of radiation of different wavelengths in <em>achieving a given size of response</em>. This is a very important difference because dose response curves are not necessarily parallel or linear.</p>
<p>When estimating biologically effective irradiances (see section <a href="#sec:BSWFs:UVeff" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:BSWFs:UVeff">[sec:BSWFs:UVeff]</a> on page ) it is very important to use appropriate action spectra for each biological process. However, since the action spectra of many biological responses are not known, this provides a dilemma for researchers who must try to chose the action spectrum that best approximates the process they are studying. Using the wrong action spectrum can produce very large errors when predicting effective irradiance and, therefore, UV effects on plants due to e.g.&nbsp;ozone depletion <span class="citation" data-cites="Rundel1983 Cullen1997">[@Rundel1983; @Cullen1997]</span>. This is also a good reason for continued efforts to measure action spectra.</p>
<p>Building a response spectrum is fairly simple; we need to measure a plant response at a single (photon) irradiance (or fluence) for each wavelength (or narrow band), whereas for constructing an action spectrum ones needs to measure the response at several different photon fluence values for each wavelength of interest.</p>
<section id="constructing-a-monochromatic-action-spectrum" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="constructing-a-monochromatic-action-spectrum">Constructing a monochromatic action spectrum</h3>
<p>Action spectra are most frequently measured using monochromatic light, i.e.&nbsp;radiation of a single or narrow range of wavelengths. This can be achieved by the use of systems which transmit, or emit, only a defined and usually narrow range of wavelengths, e.g.&nbsp;band-pass filters, LEDs, spectrographs, or lasers (see Chapter <a href="#chap:manipulating" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:manipulating">[chap:manipulating]</a> for details about radiation sources). It is also possible to build, for example, an UV action spectrum with background irradiation of other wavelengths such us PAR.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Shropshire1972">@Shropshire1972</span> describes in detail the theory behind monochromatic action spectra, and the assumptions needed for an action spectrum to match the absorption spectrum of a photoreceptor pigment. He also considers the problem of how screening by other or the same pigments can distort the shape of action spectra. He gives examples for visible radiation but the theoretical considerations are fully applicable to ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>To construct a true action spectrum we first need to measure dose response curves for radiation of different wavelengths (Figure <a href="#fig:construct:action:spectrum" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:construct:action:spectrum">[fig:construct:action:spectrum]</a>). The more curves we measure and the narrower the wavelength range used for each of these, the more spectral detail will be visible in the action spectrum built from them. For each of these curves, we should use a range of photon fluences yielding response sizes going from relatively small responses to close to the maximum response size (close to saturation). The photon fluence values used should increase exponentially. Photon fluence can be varied both by varying irradiance and/or irradiation times. If irradiation time is varied, it should be checked that reciprocity holds<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. We fit a curve to each set of dose response data, using the logarithm of the photon fluence as an independent variable. Using a logarithmic scale is expected to yield a more linear response curve than untransformed photon fluence values. From the fitted dose-response curves we calculate by interpolation the photon fluence required at each measured wavelength to obtain a response of the selected target response size. We use the photon fluence values to calculate effectiveness as <span class="math inline">\(1/ (\pfd \cdot t)\)</span> where fluence is given by the product of photon irradiance () by the irradiation time (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>), and we finally plot these effectiveness values against wavelength (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>). If the dose response curves are not parallel, the shape of the action spectrum will depend on the target response level chosen. Different causes have been suggested for the lack of parallelism of dose response curves that is sometimes observed. Two of these suggestions are self-screening effects and involvement of two or more interacting pigments in the response <span class="citation" data-cites="Shropshire1972">[@Shropshire1972]</span>. One can in principle use either quantum (=photon) or energy units, but quantum units are preferable as for any photochemical reaction absorption events always involve quanta. The shape of the spectrum will depend on whether an energy or photon basis is used.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>As the main feature of interest is the shape of the curve, UV action spectra are usually normalized to an action that is equal to one at 300&nbsp;nm. This is achieved, by dividing all the quantum (or photon) effectiveness values measured at different wavelengths, by the effectiveness at 300&nbsp;nm. The use of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda =300\)</span>&nbsp;nm is an arbitrary convention, of rather recent adoption, so you will find, especially in the older literature, other wavelengths used for the normalization.</p>
<p>A response spectrum will rarely match the absorption spectrum of the photoreceptor because of non-linearities in later steps between light absorption by the photoreceptor and an observed response. In the case of action spectra, by keeping the size of the response constant across wavelengths we attempt to minimize the effect of these non-linearities on the measured spectrum. Because of this, a properly measured action spectrum will usually closely follow the absorption spectrum of the pigment acting as photoreceptor, except from possible effect from interfering pigments.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec:polychromatic:action:spectra">Constructing a polychromatic action spectrum</h3>
<p>Monochromatic action spectra are useful to understand the nature of a specific response, e.g.&nbsp;damage, but are not suitable for calculating real effects under solar radiation. The response of a plant to light and UV radiation depends on both the amount of energy (dose-response) and the spectral composition of the radiation. Polychromatic action spectroscopy is based on a background of broad-band white light from artificial sources or natural daylight supplemented by various wavelength, for example between 280 and 360&nbsp;nm <span class="citation" data-cites="Holmes1997">[@Holmes1997]</span>. This polychromatic approach provides an action spectrum useful for assessing effects of UV under normal plant growing conditions, because the simultaneous exposure to a broad wavelength interval has a different net effect than that of an exposure to separate monochromatic radiation, due to synergisms or antagonisms between complex chemical and biological processes, for example repair mechanisms <span class="citation" data-cites="Coohill1992 madronich1993">[@Coohill1992; @madronich1993]</span>. In practice, such a realistic polychromatic radiation spectrum is achieved using a series of cut-off filters, which cut off radiation of wavelengths shorter or longer than a certain wavelength. The effect of such filters can be compared to the effect of the variable thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer. Figure <a href="#fig:Poly:Spectra" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:Poly:Spectra">[fig:Poly:Spectra]</a> shows examples of spectral irradiance for broad band light from lamps filtered by different cut-off filters. The cut-off wavelength usually refers to the wavelength of 50% transmission.</p>

<p>The original approach, so called differential polychromatic action spectroscopy, is described by <span class="citation" data-cites="Rundel1983">@Rundel1983</span>. Different biological responses are proportional to different specific treatments, for example exposures. Thus, an action spectrum can be estimated by quantifying differences in responses between successive treatments. The number of treatments required depends on the relative change in response over a wavelength interval. One example of a quantifiable effect would be change in the observed concentrations of flavonols.</p>
<section id="app:polychromatic:math" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="app:polychromatic:math">The mathematics behind polychromatic action spectra</h4>
<p>The average proportionality <span class="math inline">\(\overline{s}\)</span> between differences in the biological effective response of successive treatments <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta W_{be,i}\)</span>, and differences in exposure (fluence rate multiplied by exposure time), <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\exposure[i]\)</span> is given by an average quantity <span class="math display">\[\overline{s_i} = \frac{\Delta W_{be,i}}{\Delta\exposure[i]}\]</span> All the values of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{s_i}\)</span> together are represented in the action spectrum. If the wavebands of each treatment are small enough, an action spectrum <span class="math inline">\(s(\lambda)\)</span> can be expressed by a mathematical function. Different functions are discussed <span class="citation" data-cites="Rundel1983 Cullen1997">[@Rundel1983; @Cullen1997]</span>. In the simplest case the factors <span class="math inline">\(\overline{s_i}\)</span> are positive and decrease exponentially with increasing wavelength. Thus, one common form of <span class="math inline">\(s(\lambda)\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[s(\lambda) = \mathrm{e}^{-k(\lambda-\lambda_0)} \label{Equ:BSWF:exp}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a parameter, which has to be obtained for each different biological effect using a fitting procedure, and a wavelength <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_0\)</span>, where the action spectra are normalised to unity, e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_0=300\)</span>&nbsp;nm. Other functions including a polynomial dependence on <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> are also possible and perhaps necessary for describing complex mechanisms.</p>
<p>For the interpretation of the experimental data, the biological effective response <span class="math inline">\(W_{be}\)</span>, it is necessary to consider the wavelength dependency. Thus, it is crucial that the entire spectral irradiance <span class="math inline">\(\irr(\lambda,t)\)</span> during the experiment is known. Broad-band meters are not suitable in most cases. This dependency is included in the biological effective dose function (exposure) <span class="math inline">\(\exposure[be]\)</span>, given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

&amp; = &amp; \int_\lambda \enspace s(\lambda) \cdot \exposure(\lambda) \enspace{\rm d}\lambda \label{Equ:Dose:be}
\end{aligned}\]</span> A mathematical model can separate wavelength and dose dependency for a set of experimental data by the use of mathematical functions describing <span class="math inline">\(W_{be}(\exposure[be])\)</span> and optimisation procedures, e.g.&nbsp;non-linear curve fitting <span class="citation" data-cites="Cullen1997 Ghetti1999 Ibdah2002 goetz10">[@Cullen1997; @Ghetti1999; @Ibdah2002; @goetz10]</span>. The model assumes that photons at different wavelengths act independently, but with different quantum efficiency at the same absorption site, and therefore with the same mechanism. Regarding the shape and saturation of the observed effect, different functions can describe the data of <span class="math inline">\(W_{be}(H_{be})\)</span>, for example a linear, hyperbolic or sigmoid function. A simple linear relation is <span class="math display">\[W_{be}(\exposure[be]) = W_0 \cdot \exposure[be] \label{Equ:Response:lin}\]</span> with the parameter <span class="math inline">\(W_0\)</span>, which has to be determined by the fitting procedure.

<p>The second sheet “spectra” contains all measured spectra of the six different scenarios under the glass filters. For the calculation of a polychromatic action spectrum in the range it is recommended that the spectrum is measured using a double-monochromator system from 280 to 400 nm in steps of 1 nm. In this experiment, the irradiance was increased from the morning until noon and then decreased until the evening, to simulate natural variation in solar radiation. This was done in four steps as shown in the picture of the third sheet “daily exposure” in figure <a href="#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet3">[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet3]</a>. As an example, typical radiation data under the glass filter WG305, measured during the experiment, are presented in table <a href="#tab:App:Poly:Spectra:UV-PAR" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:App:Poly:Spectra:UV-PAR">[tab:App:Poly:Spectra:UV-PAR]</a>. This sheet is only necessary to calculate the exposure time at each light level in seconds as shown in the marked cell F8. Sheet “spectra” contains the wavelengths in column A and all the 24 spectra (six scenarios and four light levels) from column B to Y.</p>

<p>Now all sheets for input data are finished and the sheets for solving our system of equations has to be prepared. Therefore, the next sheet “weighted spectra” is filled with the information about the action spectrum function as shown in figure <a href="#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4">[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]</a>. This sheet contains the calculation of the biological effective dose function <span class="math inline">\(H_{be}\)</span> as presented in equation <a href="#Equ:Dose:be" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="Equ:Dose:be">[Equ:Dose:be]</a> on page . First, for the action spectrum <span class="math inline">\(s(\lambda)\)</span> an exponential function in chosen, as explained for equation <a href="#Equ:BSWF:exp" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="Equ:BSWF:exp">[Equ:BSWF:exp]</a> on page . Column A includes the wavelengths and column B the estimated value of the action spectrum using the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_0=300\)</span> nm of cell B4 and <span class="math inline">\(k=0.200\)</span> nm<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> of cell B5 (marked red in figure <a href="#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4">[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]</a>). This cell is only a link to cell B11 in the next sheet “SOLVER”. Because it is only the starting value of the optimisation procedure, the values of column B do not represent the real action spectrum. These values will change during optimisation. Below row 6, column D and the following columns (in this case to column AA) include the values of the action spectrum of column B multiplied by the spectral irradiances of each scenario and light levels of sheet “spectra”. Row 1 and 2 include the estimation of the doses. The cells in row 2 from column D and the following columns represent the integration over the wavelengths from 280 to 400 nm of each column beneath multiplied by the exposure time of the respective scenario and light level as previously calculated in the sheet “daily exposure”. Integration in Excel is done by adding the values of the cells regarding the wavelength step as shown for the marked cell D2 in figure <a href="#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4">[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Sheet4]</a>. Here it is 1 nm. To get doses in units of Ws m<span class="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span> (J m<span class="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span>), the sum is divided by a factor of 1000 because the spectral irradiances were measured in mW m<span class="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span> nm<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>. The daily dose (in kJ m<span class="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span>) is then calculated in row 1 for each scenario by adding the four values of the light levels. These daily doses are now needed for further calculations in the next sheet “SOLVER”.</p>

<p>The sheet “SOLVER” as illustrated in figure <a href="#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solver0" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solver0">[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solver0]</a> includes the comparison of the measured and modelled data—as table and figure. The first five rows are a short explanation of the entire model. Especially row 5 contains the mathematical function describing the measured biological response <span class="math inline">\(W_{be}\)</span>, which was the flavonoid content of lutonarin in the first leaf of barley. Here, a sigmoid function was chosen, given by <span class="math display">\[W_{be} = \frac{W_0}{1+\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\exposure[be]-\exposure[0]}{b}}} \label{Equ:Response:sigmoid}\]</span> Using this function, the values of each scenario of row 15 were calculated. Therefore, the variable coefficients <span class="math inline">\(W_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\exposure[0]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> as well as their constraints from row 8 to 11 were used. Row 14 includes the mean values of each treatment derived in the first sheet “leaf data”. The squared differences of measured and modelled data are calculated in row 16 and added up in cell C17. All cells are now prepared and we can start to optimise our variable coefficients by minimising the value of cell C17. Thus, we mark this cell by clicking on it and choose from the menu <code>Tools</code><span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span><code>Solver</code>. A new small window called “Solver Parameters” will appear as shown in the left part of figure <a href="#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam">[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam]</a>. Here, the target cell was C17 and the box for minimisation was checked. The optimisation was done by changing the cells B8 to B11 concerning all constraints listed in the sheet. By clicking on the button “Options”, another window will pop up, where the parameters for the optimisation algorithm are defined (right part of figure <a href="#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam">[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solverparam]</a>). In this example, a non-linear Newton method was used. The parameters of the upper left part of the window define the number of iterations or the maximum time for calculation as well as the precision or tolerance of the result. After inserting the numbers and checking the necessary boxes, click “OK” to return to the window “Solver Parameters”. Here, the optimisation starts by clicking on “Solve”. After a while, the program returns a message if the search succeeded and by accepting, the result is written into the cells of sheet “SOLVER” chosen for changing.</p>

<p>The final result for the data in this example is shown in figure <a href="#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved">[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved]</a>. The sum of the squared differences was minimised to 0.13. The left graph in the bottom of figure <a href="#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved">[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved]</a> shows two bars for each scenario, one for the measured leaf data of row 14 (yellow) and the other one for the modelled data of row 15 (purple). The result looks promising. The most important parameter regarding the action spectrum is <span class="math inline">\(k=0.126\)</span> nm<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> in cell B11. This value was used to plot the actual action spectrum of this study in the upper right graph of figure <a href="#fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved">[fig:App:Poly:Spectra:Solved]</a>. Our action spectrum is valid for wavelengths between 280 and 400 nm, that interval which was chosen for integration in sheet “weighted spectra”.</p>

<p>This example describes just one possibility to solve a multi-variable and non-linear problem. For example, there is also a plugin available for Calc in OpenOffice.org. Therefore, if using Calc instead of Excel, the file <code>NLPSolver.oxt</code><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> has to be installed by the extension manager. Other search algorithms are used in this tool, but the result will be the same.</p>
